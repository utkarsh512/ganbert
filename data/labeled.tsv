NONE you should know that for the only way for your idea to work people must have to be able to think of consequence before they break a law and since you re a cop you should know that people simply do nt do that we kill people if they murder and people still murder if a guy doe something fucked up for their next fix they are just looking for their next fix they are nt thinking of the long term consequence you are a cop you know this

NONE i m beginning to think that you re the problem here i have far more experience in this area than you and i m telling you that these thing do nt work how you think they work yet you just respond that you re entirely confident that your misguided perception is correct you do understand how arrogant your supposition are right
AH did you see my earlier post regarding disaster insurance do you feel a need to purposely put word into other people s mouth instead of actually reading what they said if so why why do you equate thing like poor dietary choice lot of human input and control and childhood cancer much le likely zero human input and control ha anyone in this entire thread mentioned that kid gosh darn it just are nt responsible these day no it appears you have a reading comprehension issue andor a critical thinking issue there is no other side that s obviously false demonstrably false a many people do in fact support this bill over ocare how do you reconcile this with your statement or do you simply not and carry on without any self examination how often do you post obviously inaccurate thing and adding curse word or demeaning others typically expose the flaw in or absence of your reasoning versus actually convincing people of the validity of your point
NONE do you believe that the amounttype of social pressure against msf assumption of eating disorder assumption of unhealthy behaviour etc is proportionally correct to the act of msf or do you believe it is too great i ve never witnessed the behavior firsthand not any negative response to it so i ca nt speak to that if it s treated on the same level a anorexia nervosa that s excessive if it s treated on the same level a buying perfectly good food and throwing it in the trash that seems more proper am i to understand then that you feel that there should be negative social pressure but that it is too extreme compared to the act i defer to my statement above i ca nt speak accurately to the level of response this currently receives having never witnessed it i say only that it is a problem and should receive a negative response something on the same level a someone walking out of a grocery store and throwing their bag right in the dumpster
AH alimony hearing for the last time are not the same thing the why is irrelevant the hearsay a to the why would not be admissible because it would be irrelevant but hey you believe what you wan na believe and do nt let anyone fuck you up with the fact mmkay
NONE i think your statement is too vague to be meaningful for the most part we do nt give a shit about what a stranger say to u whether they are labeling or saying anything else however if we care about someone and know them and say hey man i think that s racist that can be the start of a conversation
AH what kind of mental gymnastics were you professionally trained in to think that only religion could support it and congrats for not being able to wrap your mind around the concept of exaggeration you d think you d be able to do that with your flexibility given your profession and all you can find imbecile who d say anything but those belong in mental institution not survey but if you were to do such a global survey you can extremely safely bet on a result of supporting it go ahead and find a single person that would say that the life of an old man is worth more than that of a young child go ahead but seriously you should get some sort of prize for trolling
NONE well i can think of a few pro to a live debate that you might not have considered being the president you do have to think on your foot sometimes you are called upon to make a snap decision that could possibly shape the world not to mention when talking to foreign leader where you do nt exactly get time to do your research before answering their question if the debate were nt live you would nt be hearing a word from the man who is wanting to run the country you d hear a professionally written report using them a a mouth piece i d say it more of a performance if the individual is nt even speaking their own word but instead those of someone who might be far more qualified than the speaker
AH you know what man fuck you you re clearly just a simpleminded asshole incapable of dealing with the complexity of the issue at hand why do nt you just crawl back into the racist homophobic hole you came out of and leave the grown ups to discus the issue is that really a person that you want to continue a discussion with whether it is about food stamp hockey or disney movie
NONE that s a white lie in that it omits the detail and context do nt you think it also open up a new line of questioning like why are the bad guy hurting those kid and why is nt there someone to help them that s a lot of idea to pile on a kid that probably would nt understand them and would lead to a stilted view of reality
AH man you come up with one point you think is good and lean on it like a motherfucker do nt you i m ignoring your air metaphor you absolutely can put a value on the mona lisa everything ha a value just because you can conceptualize it doe nt mean it doe nt exist if someone offered the louvre a trillion dollar for the mona lisa they d give it up in the space between heartbeat so yes it absolutely ha a quantifiable value
NONE that s true but doe it matter you re still guilty of doing it if you killed someone because you value money more than human life you need to be stopped or fixed if a an artist you create good thing you should still be proud of it because most people ca nt do it the whole choice thingy is a bit weird honestly you technically always have a choice it s just that you will always pick the most logical for you option why would nt you
AH you re being an utter dick every comment you make make you seem le credible if you understand what you re talking about and if your claim is so easily proven you d explain it hiding behind ad hominem attack and appeal to authority make you seem ignorant also you do nt have to have a degree to be able to competently speak on an issue i m currently in law school and many of the people who come speak to u about legal topic are not lawyer but they do have valuable experience knowledge and insight in short stop being such an arrogant dismissive fuck not sure if this comment will get me banned but you really pissed me off
NONE to condescend someone implies that you see yourself a superior so no it s generally written into the social code that one is nt to view themselves a better than others since that s really selfcentered if you disagree that s fine i m not gon na try to convince you otherwise because i think it lie too heavily in opinion for any form of debate over it i d also like to address this type of behavior doesnt warrent empathy i think you re confusing empathy with sympathy i do nt have to feel bad for you or think your feeling are justified to understand what your feeling are if you do nt extend empathy and understand why someone think the way they do how are you supposed to know how to speak to them in a way they ll listen to and understand
AH well that s retarded lol and how many of these push back are caused by a misunderstanding on what a disability is because of society perception of the idea of a disability let me guess they do nt want it considered a disability because they can life full and enriched life while they have the benefit of being born in a first world society i wonder if they bother to spare a thought to those who are deaf and not so fortunate the thing is no one is claiming people with disability ca nt live rich and fulfilling life just that it s a bit harder for them to and a lot harder for society to reach a point where that is even a conceivable possibility for the average
NONE i ca nt speak for transgender people but i can speak a a ci male who totally hate gender role and say that gender role are hammered into u repeatedly by society all the time and that shit just is nt going away any time soon that s one possible reason to deal with gender in the first place i mean it s not a construct transgender people made up it s a framework that s been handed down and permeates the world we were born into all the question you ask are extremely lovely one i try to shed gender a an identity in many of my personal relationship but the simple fact is we live in a society built on it right now and it s how most people make sense of the world

AH lot of reason we american need to stop the idea of presidential family dynasty now not later hilary is neither an honest person or a person that admits to personal mistake hilary hide thing and lie when caught hilary is a corporate america a trump so nothing would change there most importantly imo is we need to shake both political party out of their current pro business pro foreign policy way an stop our seeming endless use of war and assassination a federal policy the u can survive a bad president but we can not survive the selling out of the constitution and american ideal and standard to foreign and domestic corporations my reply to another guy your only apparent reasoning is personal attack and insult so ingest defecated matter and vocalize at our planet only natural orbiting satellite then cease all bodily function
NONE do you like argueimg with moron because this is how you argue with moron no one worth speaking to would actually believe that this is a subject worthy of debate obama neither ha or doe not have the right to call the white house his house the consideration itself is so incredibly trivial it doe nt even rise to the level of requiring the invoking of right justification or scrutiny those who are complaining have no actual concern for the technicality of home ownership renter right or the station of the president and the philosophical ramification of his living situation they are not reacting to the reality of the situation a glib and slightly aggressive but mostly off hand jab at a rude person they are reacting to whatever nightmare fever dream they imagine obama represents and will use any and all opportunity to criticize him regardless of their triviality
AH according to the police report and what reason would a man who led the city paying to a woman he beat and a man who wa deemed unstable and unfit for duty have to lie absolutely none the police have our best interest at heart all of the time where is the world you live in i d like to visit one day

NONE i do nt see it a a problem a long a the person posing the view is open respond to the one you feel deserve to be and be polite if others want to try to change your view it their choice if they want to ignore your view then that is their choice too if you are just venting it will be obvious to me and i know when to stop posting in one way it good because some people post thing i ve never thought of and others will pick up the view and carry it in a non reactionary way
AH now apologize for even commenting here
NONE seriously thank you for being here
AH astra you subsentient piece of pond scum you seem under some misapprehension that we are having a discussion here i am simply warning others of the presence of jackbooted thug and how your bigotry influence your worldview and how you are hardly some innocent observer here discussing thing with shitstains like you is pointless those who are truly invested in an ideology of hatred have no ability to discus anything they are simply dangerous and sick i have no desire to discus anything with scum like you i simply warn others about you it s about how i d treat david duke oh and a for your lie i do believe you ve gotten your latest story confused not that it s hard it s always about brennan somehow defending herself and being blackmailed or something not that she s a lawyer making high six figure and specializing in helping out venture capitalist firm nope it s all about how she s just downtrodden and defending herself by attacking others but i suppose that s how ideology of hatred always justify themselves we re not attacking others we re just defending ourselves from niggersjewswhatever
NONE it s wise to resist drawing conclusion about the many from the action of a few meaning maybe your atheist cohort are just being jerky about religion why could be due to growing up in a religious atmosphere and wanting to distance themselves from it or they could be using their lack of belief a a way to feel better about themselves by putting religious folk down maybe they just do nt see any need to discus religion in any context just a short list but it doe nt really matter if they re acting like insufferable prick that s on them not on atheism i speak a someone who considers herself nonreligiousnonspiritual i d rather that people keep their belief to themselves and out of politics but i m not about to be rude to others i know others who are the same so i m definitely not some anomaly and i ve met my share of religious folk who did nt respect my nonreligious boundary so the problem do nt solely lie on one side of the fence in short it s a people thing not a belief thing
AH til generally mean in every instance
NONE cisgender is sjw speak for normal
AH almost the entire recovery from the recession had occurred in a handful of the richest rich county these people who already were hurting got hatcheted by the recession have seen none of this supposed recovery yet they are told by obese minority on welfare that they deserve their suffering because some made up bullshit about racism and how the poor black who dy being a dumb thug is their fault minority are parasite in general but in the case of actual american these parasite are trying to suck at an already bled corpse the left that den of class traitor chant they are for the working class then stab them in the back at every turn for their special need or snowflake constituency and ignoring the cultural and social ideal of the worker of the nation i ca nt wait for the democrat party to die and their snowflake constituency to be brought to the chopping block to make them pay ten time what they took during these last fifty year you too are a class traitor and parasite and enemy of the people though so you who are the oppressor have a hard time seeing the way you raped the fatherland
NONE ok i agree with your logic nazi germany is evidence that what you say ha historical evidence a they got elected by promising to glorify the german worker through nationalist socialism however in a country where the market system creates and deepens poverty to further punish them by not letting these people that have been marginalized by the system by not letting them vote is probably a first step to totalitarianism the only reason you do nt want to give all power to corporation wealthy and other elite is that this will benefit too few and the majority will vote against all this so those in power ca nt be too blatant leaving poor out of the system will only encourage to create more poor and have a oligarchy which is the final step before totalitarianism so what is the solution to temper oligarchy and keep the middle class form getting poorer a long a you have a majority of people thinking well it could be worse then you can keep people off the street marching voting for extremist and behaving within reason it s mediocre but i think can last another couple of decade at least after that i think onlinegenerated and funded movement could topple corrupt and abusive government somewhat
AH you re wrong in that it s okay or sensible to use it a a slur there s something worse than a slur judgment and preaching and minding other people s business the gay people s business and the business of straight using the term i m telling you that it s not a slur and that s not what people mean you d know that too if you heard what they were saying in good faith instead of posh judging and being extremely superficial about it also you can stop accusing me of homophobia not that i care when it come to the issue but your pomp is actually extremely offensive stop showing me your as and maybe come down a few notch
NONE so essentially i should just ignore what people think and be a good person to everyone i meet and if they stereotype me based off my accent where i m from and the politics of where i live then the problem lie with them and not me obviously be a good person is going to be something i endorse even a a new yorker for the most part i think that if people judge others based on where they re from they re dick for the most part though i do nt think people are judgmental dick when it come down to it they bloviate on the internet but it s just that not well considered or deeply held opinion
AH shut the fuck up donny
NONE wow fuck everything about this
AH the same could be said about murder assault and robbery but we do nt say we live a murder culture or assault right but we do nt make justification and excuse for muderers like we do rapist well she should nt have been wearing that well she should nt have been drinking that much well he should nt have gone to jail however i think this conversation end right here are ignorant tumblr feminist for the most part your bias is hilarious clear and i have no intention of continuing this ridiculous farce of a discussion edit oh look a posting history of rtumblrinaction and rfatpeoplestories a shining example of a human
NONE would you also agree that i ca nt be a misogynist i love my mom is a valid defense then do nt the majority of allegedly sexist people have this defense the truth is we often make exception for people with whom we are close we might also form prejudice because of those people eg the only woman that is any good is my mother and my wifegirlfriend is shitty because they re not sufficiently like her or my black friend is nt like other black people he doe nt deal drug or steal or participate in drivebys etc we form these prejudice because we think the people we know are exception to rule that do nt exist
AH i mean the article said he photoshopped it and he got banned for it but i guess it s more reasonable to assume that twitter is trying to censor him and that because leslie tweeted something racist she deserved all the abuse also how do i know your tweet is nt edited if you ca nt trust washington post i ll be dammed if i trust someone who think that calling milo out on his regressive view is somehow shit slinging and equal to causing violent harassment on an actress that he doe nt even fucking know but i m probably not going to convince you of anything milo could call woman and minority second class citizen he could say that homosexual are inferior he could say it clear a day and judging from your amazing mental dissonance calling white people shit racist siccing the internet equivalent of a lynch mob on a black person mild offense no racism here you d jump through hoop to prove how people are misinterpreting his shitposts please move along
NONE you re bringing in a whole lot of baggage that is nt relevant focusing on the issue here me saying i think rush limbaugh is a racist classist hateful dick and i wish he d quit is not in any way censorship and if you think it is then you betray a fundamental misunderstanding censorship would be using force or law to get him to stop talking no matter how much he want to that s not what we re talking about here we re talking about an artist put out a work a critic criticizes that artist and that work for it content if someone publishes a racist novel am i not allowed to write a review saying this book is racist to flip it on you are you advocating that the critic should be silenced and censored that they should not have the right to say what they want or are you simply criticizing them for what they say while accepting their right to say it assuming the latter guess what neither side is advocating censorship
AH for instance in the u election if hillary clinton win i will probably be le likely to donate my organ a it will prove the system is rigged you can not possibly be serious are you year old
NONE i think you need to pick the issue most important to you and vote for the person who will screw them up the least it look like sander then clinton then cruz would be the candidate you d prefer

AH fuck off not everyone is an addict
NONE this is a pretty fucking good comment
AH this statement is nothing but pure speculation you d have to be willfully ignorant not to see that a the logical outcome in which case i ca nt debate ignorance to claim that myself and million of others are essentially spoiled entitled little brat is a tad absurd i do nt have to claim anything you are making it self evident with the way you re behaving you re asking a question and getting and answer you do nt like and throwing a fit over it a a community
NONE they say they re not going to convince anyone of anything because it allows them to not take any criticism on the point they can simply label you a someone who doe nt agree with their tenant and that s end of it there wa no point in their comment where you could be ambiguous about it the comment can be summed up by saying this is the way it is if you think anything else we re not having the same conversation it s an easy cop out to be able to be selfrighteous while at the same time impervious to any backlash
AH i can feel your ignorance seeping through my screen
NONE i stand up but spread my cheek to get a full wipe
AH anytime somebody accuses another person of astroturfing they just make themself look like an idiot

NONE in some way like abortion and ssm but the liberal agenda on gun control and hunting for example is very knee jerky and based on emotion for example i hear the the deer are too cute to kill or how can you kill bami more time than i can count
AH literally no one mentioned it or exhibited it until you brought it up yes i brought it up are you the thought police i do nt understand why you hate idea so much why am i not allowed to shift my feeling this much without your permission athlete were never funding your education calm down and use that reading comprehension that i m sure you must have somewhere deep inside we re talking about me changing my assumption right so i m saying when i wa under the impression that athlete were funding my education we re talking about idea in past and present term one of u is talking about idea using the idea a a situation like it wa a theoretical point in time made moot honestly if you just want to pick a super useful textbased fight on the internet for the sake of it say that and do nt tiptoe around it waiting for someone else to make the first move
NONE not the person you responded to here btw now you re just displaying your lack of knowledge on this topic if you spent any amount of time on a chan message board you d know how common this meme is i m not sure why people insist on having such a strong opinion on something they clearly do nt understand i m curious if we re able to get some hard number on this since otherwise it will be all just a tug of war over whose filter bubble we accept a representative but either way it s not like this is nt just settled when we see that percent of pepe meme used are nt racist there is a joke about an effect that feel relevant here see that bridge i build that myself in fact i have build many bridge been doing it for year now so do you think they d start calling me tom the bridge builder nooo but you fuck just one goat
AH because society ha been doing this way for century and it is nt hurting anything going against it will only cause confusion socially and fuck rule number one downvote me asshole

NONE i just want to put this here to help prove your point better http qphecquoracdnnetmainqimgaaecdfeacacbbeada
AH oh dear another mra trained in politicalspeak suicide ha varying cause obviously but you re just making an extremely liberal assumption that woman s attempt are largely fake and then you are throwing question at me like do you think woman are stupid which is entirely irrelevant i wo nt toil with it i ve already explained in previous post and if you can not be bothered to read i can not be bothered to dignify an irrelevant question and again you re ignoring division where it is convenient to you the elderly are the most likely to commit suicide why well it is obvious but you re not calling it elderly issue are you you re calling it men issue you re insisting forcing shoehorning ca nt live without the gender narrative in this your ignoring nuance wherever it is convenient my statement wa also not intended to create competition between men s and woman s suicide it wa intended to broaden the perspective that suicidal behavior is not a maleexclusive problem it is not it s an outcome of social isolation among various other factor i do nt understand why mra s feel this compulsion to commandeer social issue with the male oppression stamp you re the same uneducated and ridiculous and your message board schooling can only take you so far do nt parrot thing i ve said back to me a if they were your original thought it demonstrates that you do nt actually even understand what is going on do nt come to me with anymore of your politicalspeak i see right through it
NONE i m an advocate for political correctness though if you met me otherwise you d think i were nt but i take issue with by and large political correctness is a great tool it can make people think about their word and action and how word lead to action that doe nt mean any instance where it s applied is good or that it s a great thing no matter what we used to call people with disability differently abled that s abhorrent now simply because you have the word different right in there and it s an attempt to whitewash reality people with disability know they re disabled it s understandable to be upset when you have to assert and reassert your identity and integrity a a person though so i totally understand where they were coming from but that doe nt mean we are nt making misstep now a lot of fringe thinking ha started to take over because that s what writes article fox is nt challenging whether or not we can or should say retarded or nigger but the fringe idea that are nt going to go very far coming from one student s arrogant blogwriting style if it s a matter of volume i ll have to disagree a lot of what we focus on miss the point and is unevenly distributed i listened to an interview where someone referred to white people a white but clearly stopped themselves from saying black because that ha a racist tone to it for sure the problem is an uneven distribution of effort which cause even more discord i do nt know how many people would pick up on that but given enough time they would we re a large society and pc want to deal with very niche issue and interest we have to think bigger like you might hint at but right now it s being used in a way that s counterproductive
AH wow you re being so deliberately obtuse it s like you re trying to make yourself look bad when people say period instead of actually writing a period that doe nt mean there is nothing else they want to say ever it mean they are saying there is no acceptable counterargument to what they just said and that the argument is completely clear and not open to interpretation
NONE but is it any ruder to skip the part where you refuse the money and instead say wow you really did nt have to do this but thank you so much without actually refusing personally while that certainly is nt rude i do think that is le polite that refusing once i think that accepting on the first offer even if you say wow you did nt have to still implies that you expected it
AH when ryan ran for vp he wa a wacist sexist islamaphobic meanie prove it same a john mccain prove it a you do trump what lie are espoused about trump along these line he say bigoted shit constantly and it s pointed out it s clear the root of your thinking though you re intellectually lazy so you monolithize the left you ca nt be surprised people stopped listening when you changed the meaning of word to win argument hah no such thing ha been done you re just clinging to outlier and using them to say akshually degrading black men a lazy is nt racist because insert stereotyping bullshit we did nt destroy the word you beat it to death and decided to change it a you pleased for your argument it s a sad thing but what can you do no such thing ha been done you just refuse to acknowledge lesser form of racism that are very much real
NONE i try to refrain from saying retard just because i know it offends some and not others and i d rather not needlessly piss someone off when i can use different word to get my message across without rustling any jimmy that being said i think conversation like this often break down due to what people view a racist or ableist or sexist some people think racist the kkk or ableist throwing the mentally challenged in ward where they have experiment done on them these people obviously would balk at being called ableist or racist because the image they have in their mind of a racist is so horrible rather think about avenue q if you do nt know what that is you re welcome http wwwyoutubecomwatch vrovfzsdoem everyone s a little bit racist everyone s a little bit ableist there are tiny little thing we all do which just are it s not the end of the world to say retard but it is ableist

AH i never said it wa an ad hominen i said it would only be an ad hominem if calling dave an asshole wa a counter to his argument maybe you should work on your reading comprehension instead of offering unsolicited advice to me that ha nothing to do with the cmv the value anyone place on a diamond ring is based on an outdated tradition supported by a logical fallacy of a diamond being a woman s best friend and if i m so wrong why do you keep replying instead of moving on with your life
NONE nobody like them tax till the biggest dawg on the block come callin for his piece of that scratch off ticket while i m here i ve noticed a small discrepancy in the content of your current post and that of your op it seem you support ubi which would be a direct contradiction to libertarian thought how is that you can hold that view and still maintain that liberstarianism is the one true political philosophy that literally everyone should follow

NONE i m not sure if hedonism is a particularly tenable paradigm to live by work might be perfectly dull for example but enable you to maximize your pleasure in the future in a way that make it so that on the whole you have more pleasure even if that mean not having or having the opposite of pleasure right now not looking past the length of your nose is a detriment to the pleasure you ll have in the future also your very survival depends on performing task that are nt particularly enjoyable for example i do nt particularly enjoy brushing my teeth but i do enjoy good dental health howbout using the restroom fun is nt the word i would use to describe it now you might object and say brushing your teeth or taking a dump doe nt constitute work and i might agree if you had nt defined work a whatever you can measure in joule

NONE i agree with you op the reference did nt bother me so much since i know going into it that that s what it would be like however it read like a young adult novel in term of prose and level of maturity yet it is apparently targeted at year old i thought it sucked too
AH your charade of willful ignorance is a brilliant display of your lack of intellect if you truly think that minority are intentionally looking past these pro white pro male pro status quo supposed stances at the same time looking for change then you are quite simply a moron you re really going to need to work on your temper if you re going to finish your b from devry also google want it joke back a i said i deal with ape like you everyday and it s funny that every moron like you think i m white till i flat out say i m a minority you have preconceived judgement and notion i understand that but if you re going to come to the table of debate and discussion come with an argument not this is how i feel about white people and white society your victimmentality is a disease
NONE are nt the most attractive people those who do nt need someone else and the most unattractive are clingy needy people maybe this is just my backwards thinking to some people sure but not to everyone personally i quite like being needed emotionally so i m perfectly happy with clingy the constant doing and striving that s prevalent in today s society wear me out mentally so do nt be part of it that s your right personally i see doing nothing a a literal waste of time and that s my opinion even still in the most literal sense even doing nothing for the sake of doing nothing is still an agenda at that point your agenda is to not have an agenda to separate from the rat race and just be but is nt the end goal of that to bring yourself some clarity and relaxation a defined goal and therefore agenda

NONE i m not american but i would just like something cleared up is nt freedom of speech the ability to convey idea and opinion freely so the thing itself doe nt cover thing like lying you do nt have complete freedom in misrepresenting information lying but you have the right to believe and express your belief freely you seem to be confusing two thing freedom of speech a a thing and the ability to say whatever you want they re not the same thing no you should nt be able to say whatever you want because then yes bank can lie to you but you should have complete freedom of speech
AH no he lie just a much a any political you just think it s a lot because you adore the lugnenpresse and other such vermin personal business yes but when you are in charge of company you are expected to use grey mean to turn the largest profit if you provide a low quality product you should be told to fuck off for trying to fraud
NONE i do agree with you but is it really a bad thing that we no longer commodify education to the point that we are paying thousand of dollar for a piece of paper that say we know how to do a job free education would make certain field even more competitive but the quality of educationwhere you went and what you did therewill matter more than merely having one

AH it s equally okay to hate both if you want but it s also equally juvenile and wrong to hate any people group or culture just because it s different than yours the one problem i have with your scenario though is this statement i hate the way he beat his wife bill mother do you really think all redneck beat their wife do you think hood rat do nt beat their wife do you not know that domestic abuse spread out among all culture and people group even dorky people who wear ironic tshirt after you graduate high school and make it to college you ll encounter lot of people who are a lot different than you you wo nt grow a a person if your first inclination is to look down your nose at people you do nt understand while holding onto and perpetuating bigoted stereotype like the abusive redneck wish you well in the future kid just do nt grow up to be a prick
NONE in my view it is not somebody s job to make themselves more tolerable but ours to become more tolerant for example one could argue that black people should stop speaking in aave africanamerican vernacular english so that others will treat them with more respect but in my opinion there is nothing intrinsically wrong with aave people who dislike when it is spoken need to lighten up or how about gay people i ve heard the argument that we should stop supporting gay pride parade because it just make gay people seem stupid and flamboyant and reenforces stereotype who give a shit let them do what they want the homophobe need to learn to deal it s not fair to ask someone to stop doing a harmless thing that is meaningfula part of who they are for the benefit of others the others have to learn to accept that other people speak and act a different way from them that s part of growing up we learn it a child

AH really you are really going to get your panty in a knot for me asking you to clarify your statement if i knew what you meant if it wa clear what you meant i would not have asked you to clarify your position on my first reading i thought you were saying that you did nt think altruism exists now that you decided not to add a bunch of superfluous negative negative that did nothing but add confusion in your statement it is much clearer my argument wa going to go one of two way depending on how you answered but instead of just clarifying your position you replied back to me like a fucking twat and now i do nt think having a conversation with you is going to be any fun for me instead you can wallow in your delusional theory
NONE i know so which is it is your view on alcohol changed or not or is it a clash of your logic and emotion in your head trust me it s usually better to roll with your logic in a situation like this do you have a friend you could confide in this about someone who would be understanding yet still excited at the thought that you would finally give it a try that might be better than internet stranger opinion because it look like you ve logically accepted that there s nothing wrong with drinking but have this mental block in your head you put that mental block there you will be the one who ha to take it down and maybe it ll take a while but if you actually want to not feel so shameful at the idea you ll have to start somewhere baby step are fine but if you do nt move forward at all do nt expect thing to change

AH why are you always against what i have said because you are butthurt that i got the karma just start your own change your view thread if you are so unconvinced medium from around the world reflects the ethnic makeup of it target market the u is no exception just read this http timecomagencieshollywoodracialdiversity from the article the data show that minority and woman are underrepresented compared to reallife us demographic both in front of and behind the camera you might look at a person and decide that they are white but you probably are just making baseless conjecture latin american racial system are different than the one in the u for goodness sake not even the kkk doe nt think of italian a white in latin america it ha more to do with how pale your skin is and shakira is pretty pale read this http deadspincomthewhiteningofneymarhowcolorislivedinbrazil
NONE i would nt say delusion i would say it s an artificial construction many of the thing we think of a english culture come from all over the world it s pretty silly to protect something from outside influence when it is made up of outside influence in your op you stated nationalist sentiment have no place in our country because they extoll a vision of america that doe not exist and never ha i am arguing that the same is true of england there is no pure english culture to protect no magical golden age to go back to edit in your op you said that this would change your view other country should have to open themselves up to new people idea and influence i am arguing that it s not a should have to issue it s an objective fact culture are always changing and responding to new influence and there is nothing you can do about it

NONE people feel ownership for the place they spend enough time in so even if it s a privately owned web site the fact that they opened it up for anyone to join mean the effect will take hold if you do this if you lay this trap unwittingly or otherwise then thing like rsubredditcancer et al will happen at the spocklevel of logic such people would move somewhere else if they do nt like what the site s owner are doing go to voatco http voatco and leave u alone but we re not spock we re kirk fuck the neutral zone in the future i think the operator of forum similar to reddit will recognise the implicit social deal you like all this traffic and commercial potential you like having over million pageviews per month you like being cited in mainstream news article okay well that come at a cost beside your server and bandwith this place is now ours no backsies i ve been told that the american civil war wa not really about slavery but about the degree of control that the federal government wanted to put on the state after a hundred year of minding their own business the expectation of selfcontrol wa already baked in so even a mindbogglingly positive policy such a the abolition of slavery wa the canary in the coalmine the state revolted and it got messy what s happening on reddit is at a microscopic level compared to the civil war but many of the same feeling are mixed in it s just part of human nature and that s why pao s action will be harmful the implicit contract wa broken no matter how good the intention for breaking it
AH it ha nothing to do with being easy to refute i do nt have to refute thing that you pretend i ve said it s that simple this entire time i have been explaining why what you said fit the mold of the white savior complex and now you re going to say you did nt say these thing i think in the interest of fairness i ll stop here if you can maybe not call people toddler which is nt a very mature way to deal with people maybe you d have noticed that i never said it because i m not acting like a toddler edit i think i got what you mean disregard the rblacktwitter part then that wa the only time i brought it up anyway still consider the other of the article outline why speaking for black people is racist and synonymous with the white savior complex
NONE so you are telling me if you identify a male but you do nt care if your physical sex is female mmmm i think that if that happened i would feel like a woman every bit a much a i feel like a man today obviously this is hypothetical so i ca nt know for sure but that s how little my gender is part of my identity you really need to be more specific when you say you experience it differently i m really really trying to be specific that s what i ve been doing the whole point of this is that it s freaking hard for me to try to express how i feel and even to figure out if it s different from how someone else feel and better word would help sorry but i really want to understand so can please clarify what you mean even more i think i m pretty much out of word at this point sorry
AH i think i just did i d rather be pregnant than be ripped apart and i think i amply defended my opinion but whatever inbox response disabled alright i m letting you fly now cunt fly away

AH you like a lot of other neoliberals have an extremely naive view on humanity primarily due to your extremely privileged and sheltered upbringing the base state of humanity is violence that is the natural state of our specie violence rape and extermination that s what s natural for human being the sole reason you exist today is because your ancestor were fanfuckingtastic at two thing killing and fucking and no consent wa not required world peace will never ever happen there will always be violence we can work pragmatically to prevent war and reign in the suffering a much a physically possible that doe nt change humanity we ve not evolved in the slightest past our primitive ancestor culture and reading combined with strict policing to push our society into a civil state is what let you live in the ludicrously peaceful and safe society you do today just remember that s not natural that s trained behaviour
NONE a melting pot society is supposed to create new idea it s not for an infinite number of culture to exist under the same roof if there are aspect of one culture than conflict with another what do you think happens there either they change their view or they fight until only one view stand this is what unification brings out unification is nt to wipe out all aspect of one s culture it s intended to filter out the one that are not wanted pretty easy example is muslim refugee in europe whether or not it s a rampant a made out to be there wa an increase in sexual assault committed by people who in their culture would be tolerated this is superior to you should any similar idea be tolerated just because it s part of someone s culture society that can not unite do not function see human history there s a reason the term pax is applied to period after aggressive conquest

NONE while mocking fragile masculinity is becoming more common the taunting of men placing a great deal of importance on their gender role is still very much a niche phenomenon protip this is how thing should be
AH remember that what you post on the internet is nt ephemeral it s easily found and quoted here s you advocating eugenics over time the degradation of that aversion would severely harm the specie perhaps it is nt fair or pretty but it is a necessary biological protection the reinforcement of that biological aversion by society and government is crucial so ya not only are you a eugenicist you re a coward for not backing it up and a liar for denying it good day
NONE i m not so sure that any form of government could successfully support a population of b china ha been able to do it but it come at a steep price liberty transparency etc like cache said democracy is the best of what s available everything else is at the moment unworkable modern civilization itself is a pretty new thing and globalization is even newer it s not a good idea to ditch the system but rather to work to improve it and that is nt an impossible task
AH there are plenty of aspect of detroit s economy that are socialized the worker own the business you re trying to bring your own agenda into this and failing miserably at changing anyone s view by insulting others and then propping up your own agenda do nt blame me you have no class consciousness no concept of insult proving again your ignorance do you not know the meaning of the word no actual concept of capitalism except a a god that ca nt be challenged if all you expect to do is prop up your fallacy your ego this is the wrong sub
NONE i think a lot of the discussion and argument here are going to find the point of disagreeance at what you or yourself are are they the primary personality attribute you consider yourself to have if so yourself is a pretty easily identifiable being are they your decision making property want desire ability etc if so this is the most literal definition of your existence and fully encompasses everything you could ever do without knowing what you believe yourself is we ca nt argue whether it s possible to be anything else
AH you talk a if you are some authority on these subject and dismiss those that claim they do indeed have these condition with regard to adhd and lack of interest read this are these people bullshitting aswell http wwwredditcomradhdcommentsknmgmadhdandpermanentboredom http wwwredditcomradhdcommentsoonsdoeshyperboredomsoundlikeagooddescription what on earth make you think i m lying about depression this is hilarious if you had depression you would know the difference between being in a medically depressed state and a sad state is like night and day and that it blindingly obvious to the subject i already do stuff for my depression anyway the fact is none of these problem are my fault you have piss poor reading comprehension because none of your argument ha adressed my op you just came here to rant and tell me to do something about my problem which i already do anyway
NONE again i totally agree i understand finding it offensive and i completely agree what it come down to though is that you actively think about this topic someone else might not for whatever reason i think driving is a terrifying concept i think a way we rationalize being able to move at these speed is by placing an extreme amount of confidence in our ability we know the risk of driving how many people die from it and in order to pull out on to the road we tell ourselves that we are good at this i think this is really similar to people who are okay with spanking despite strong evidence it s one of those thing that people just are unable to be persuaded of people have trouble with it because they feel they are saying their parent were bad parent combine that with the fact that people can always target worse driver a you ve probably seen in this thread i think you will wind up with a lot of driver who are irresponsible and do nt use blinker but would be considered friendly nice or generous in many other aspect of their life
AH bullshit though congratulation on using two paragraph to say nothing of substance what is it with moron and their urge to call other people out you ve made not a single reply in this thread that would hold up to a minimum of critical thought and got called on your argument by numerous people all of which gave their answer much more thought than is really warranted but did you take that a a sign to maybe reexamine your view nooo everybody else must be wrong
NONE your argument sound valid on paper but in reality it s the same exact argument i hear from fourth grader about their time table do you have any idea how much time they ll save throughout their life by memorizing them they re net saving time and so will you anyway it depends on the subject a lot of subject are a lot more performancebased knowledge is a prerequisite for performance being able to perform only with the answer in front of you mean that you ca nt do anything
AH you sound like a miserable fuck
NONE oh my god you are a fucking terrorist
AH you made unfounded broad based generalization about my upbringing and when i corrected you you twisted it be exactly what you meant even though it wa the exact opposite of what you said your upbringing is the environment you grew up in regardless of what that may be your twisted moral view defiantly stem from how where and when you were raised i do nt view this particular opinion of yours a an isolated occurrence but rather it stem from the base of something even more sinister your core value system is disgustingly authoritarian and you ve even admitted that you want to see people suffer and you have no sympathy for criminal because you grew up in a poor neighborhood with a higher crime rate that s why your moral framework is about unwavering respect to authority and why you think fear is a justified tactic to control the mass i m condescending because i do nt believe your opinion deserves any respect in fact i m rather disgusted by the sheer level ignorance and how emotionally influenced your idea are rather it need to be dissected down to it most basic level your core ideology from which it is based off of and that s the toxic ethical foundation we know a conservatism
NONE why exactly do you want to change your view on this it s not a view if it s supported by evidence namely numerous unhappy marriage if there are statistic saying it s generally harmful then it is and your opinion whether we should be doing it is what matter and your opinion is to change a harmful practice but it s not really an opinion to say that teaching young girl that sex is a sin is mostly harmful it s an observation and that observation doe not really change tbh i ca nt think of anything that would be a strictly positive consequence that can not be achieved with different tool or teaching of the current absolutelynosexallowedcuzyougotohell mentality and plenty of people have these kind of observation in general there is nt anything wrong with preferring abstinence since it s still the safest method of contraception and avoiding std s so that could still be the main focus of church teaching and there would be nothing wrong with that but inciting fear and disgust is provably wrong so you d need to approach the subject with an entirely different mindset from what you ve described
AH you should learn to read bud i said they should nt exist not that they do nt have the right do you know your history do you know how israel wa reinstated do they have the right to exist sure they do but when their existence stem from them taking land away and oppressing others that s a problem btw i have a feeling your a jew sympathizer just so that you open your eye look up how they treat palestinian with israeli citizenship or how they treat anyone who is nt a jew in israel
NONE okay i should nt do it but there are plenty of people out there who kill animal already should they go unpunished law exist precisely to protect u from people who have bad moral thinking what about something milder like graffiti i think it s a beautiful art form and am fine with it should i be allowed to spray whatever i want over my neighbor s house on the other hand what if i believe talking loudly should be illegal do i have the right to call the cop when people talk loudly around me are they obligated to prosecute it
AH i m a surprised a you are but honestly the method you ve suggested doe nt really work either check the search bar and see mother fucker start a cmv on a topic they clearly know nothing about and argue their side for fucking hour a though they have a single leg to stand on i figured i d just cut through all of ops bull hit right off the bat this time it seems it worked
NONE you are going to have to get over the whole all relationship will be pointless i mean people wo nt get you one hundred percent but there really is nt anything inherently wrong with that i do nt get my wife she certainly doe nt get me one percent and we make it work because we each bring different idea to the table if you dated a clone of yourself it would get boring after awhile
AH interesting discussion is going on no thanks to you
NONE what do you think your comment here is contributing sarcasm
AH it assumes that corporation are good people and use those break towards production and not for profit it assumes no such thing and net profit is where increased production come from profit is the greatest thing in the world stop being so damn greedy
NONE if green power could work and be profitable those people in oil would already be making money off it the problem is that there simply is nt the return in power for the investment at the moment green energy is nt a profitable a other form of energy
AH clearly you do nt understand because most employee of the military are not soldier and no im proposing the revolutionary idea that transpeople are fit to serve and die for their country and you are saying they are not because they are trans thats you implying they are weak so dont pin that on me dumbfuck ricky bobby fuck the army anyway nah no comment on political rhetoric just dumbass rhetoric whatever man if you think trans are nt fit to serve clearly the military doe nt a they said no change will occur at this point in time despite the president tweet then why dont you get off your as and go die for a country that doe nt give a shit bout youor betteryet go jump out of a plane tomorrow because all military employee are ready to do that at a moment notice do nt be a dumb a fuck bro it too low a bar for you not to reach aight
NONE see now we are splitting hair first you said no talking ever now you are saying well when i do it i talk quietly so that s fine other people feel the same way they think they are being quiet so no one else is being bothered when you tell them to shut up they think you are being rude because in their mind they were quiet so you are unreasonable you just proved it yourself people talk in movie even the one that claim they do nt so getting a bouncer to try and sort out who is or is nt talking enough to bother other people is adding a big cost with major potential for liability and minimal chance to actually improve the theater also if there is a bouncer what s to stop people from just claiming their neighbor are being loud to get them kicked out
AH fuck off rchildfree cunt
NONE you shut your whore mouth
AH the origin poster wa ok with sexy character showing off sexuality but not with cute spunky character showing off sexuality you just changed your accusation just now you were saying this decision wa antisexuality now you re saying it s antispunkycharactersbeingsexual and that s a double standard that s a substantial shifting of goal post what s the crime here exactly keeping spunky character down if they re okay with other sexy character what are they doing wrong what is this double standard in service of if it s just to please people who do nt want woman to be sexual why doe widowmaker get a pas why would some sjw prude with an axe to grind try to scrub off the sex but only halfass it besides which you still are basing the accusation on your interpretation of blizzard s action rather than their very clear explanation despite having no reason to do so except your own personal dislike for the change if blizzard chose to show an intellectual side of widowmaker i would be ok with it if it wa part of the creative vision and not a kneejerk reaction to people complaining yeah but this still depends on your personal opinion you ve already shown that you wo nt accept blizzard s formal explanation that you will instead appoint yourself the arbiter of their motif so how would you successfully determine whether it wa part of their creative vision also they specifically said that avoiding oversexualization wa part of their design in this is part of their creative vision so instead of addressing merit of my argument you will just accuse me of hypocrisy nice i mean the other of what i write is addressing your dumb argument ca nt it be both
NONE you re talking about two different persona entirely here why would you think someone who wa into you based on a puabased first impression where you are clearly spitting game would fall for the real you once you drop the facade and reveal what appears to be a personality rather antithetical to it i mean most of the guy who get into pua and swear by it are explicitly not in it for actual relationship i have yet to see a testimonial where a bro is like yeah i negged the shit out of this girl and took her home within the hour and now we are celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary at a b b in vermont i do nt doubt that it happens just that uh i have to admit i m kind of getting mixed signal here if woman really do fall for you when they get to know you i can tell you with absolute confidence that you are already better off than basically every man who can spit mad game but ha very little going for him beyond it what are your expectation from dating if you want a relationship how will pua contribute if you want a string of sexual encounter why are your numerous positive quality relevant i may very well be a narcissist so i ll look into that i ve always thought that i m excessively modest but maybe i m narcissistic about my modesty is that a thing hooooooo boy short answer is yes in fact that s pretty much the thing slightly longer answer is that narcissism is the creation of an identity based on selfperception of trait rather than behavior read tlp brother edit the best quick narcissism selftest i ve ever heard is describe yourself and after that check this spoiler s do it again without using the word am how closely do these line up
AH you still have nt bothered to address me coward
NONE nailed it hope you do nt get downvoted to hell
AH the united state government is illegally and unconstitutionally violating my right to privacy through the action of the nsa you re an idiot if you think i m fighting for them legally mandated or not
NONE for the sake of transparency i m british not canadian but what did you smoke before thinking that any country would want to be ruled by the u or any barsterdisation of their already broken and corrupt government
AH inb op is the friend
NONE this is the only answer
AH by your logic i could link two youtube video showing human doing very good thing and draw the opposite conclusion and it would be just a illogical the difference is you have nt linked shit talk is cheap so i win a expected perfect score
NONE do you have study to point to that i assume there actually are study since it s easy to make a statistic on it and it s an interesting subject otherwise we re just guessing i believe it s better to factcheck than believe show me the number
AH who is talking about forcing drug on people or locking people up or forcing them to do anything against their will pretty obvious you are nt educated about mental health treatment maybe you re just trying to troll me i do nt know but the most important form of treatment is psychosocial rehab maintaining social contact employment and independence the worst thing that can happen for a mental illness is to be forced into a residential setting so i do nt know what you are basing your opinion on because it s clear you ve never never been exposed to mental illness or the mental health care system
NONE plus talking about mental health problem make some people uncomfortable and they pull away addressing this specifically do nt you think that people being exposed to mental illness on more casual platform such a social medium would lessen their awkwardness when confronted with the topic and ultimately help the conversation you re the only one qualified to make this call and should do what you deem best for you however i do nt see this a a very good reason to refrain from posting
AH you ask for evidence yet supply none learn how to paragraph i m not bothered with your self righteous word vomit there s nothing to discus about a tree existence stop asking for evidence in a philosophical debate it doe nt exist better here s the definition google it next but a a medical student you should know what that mean better ˈbɛtəsubmit adjective more desirable satisfactory or effective we re hoping for better weather tomorrow synonym superior finer of higher quality greater in a different class one step ahead more partly or fully recovered from illness injury or mental stress his leg wa getting better synonym healthier fitter stronger le ill more adverb more excellently or effectively jonathon could do better if he tried synonym to a higher standard in a superiorfiner way i played better today noun the better one that which is better the natural history museum book is by far the better of the two datedhumorous one s superior in social class or ability educating the young to respect their elder and better verb improve on or surpass an existing or previous level or achievement his account can hardly be bettered synonym surpass improve on beat exceed excel top cap trump eclipse outstrip outdo outmatch go one better than informalbest a record bettered by only one other nonleague side
NONE the signalnoise ratio in clothing is sufficiently high that it would be unjust to rely on clothing choice to judge people for example let s say i wore a coat inspired http gamemusicfanscomwpcontentuploadsdeusexbannerjpg by the neorenaissance aesthetic from the game deus ex human revolution in true miguel caballero fashion it s going to be bulletresistant and probably have a bigass collar the message i want to send is that i like dxhr i want to wear something that evokes that ingame concept of it wa a time of great innovation but if someone else see it they ll see the popped collar the entirely too tryhard tvtroperific badass longcoat http tvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainbadasslongcoat and the apparent rejection of current milanese fashion in other word someone who is nt plugged in clothes and social situation interact with each other in nuanced way and people can afford to be judgmental mainly because there s low cost if you were tased every time you mistook that jeanwearer a some street riffraff rather than your better for he is otherwise known a ceo maxwell you would judge them le a well when you say used to context my math mind translates that into fashion value f a b c obviously fashion value is modified by certain contextual detail a b c but you would be remiss to leave it at that without defining them for your viewer
AH wow people love to throw up on their keyboard interesting sub you win
NONE haha come over to the u and take a look at our beaner problem then we ll talk
AH i do nt think you have the spirit necessary for this sub
NONE i wo nt try to change your mind i think history will be kind to him
AH enjoy your normie existence you comment reporting cunt lol
NONE not here to change your view but totally agree with you
AH who give a fuck i thought it wa pretty fucking clear i meant it is possible but very difficult and few if any people do it even if it wa nt i ve clarified what i meant like time now shut the fuck up and move on with your life you retarded cunt
NONE it sound like you just want to avoid echo chamber and circle jerk not avoid opinion contrary to yours if so that s something i agree a lot with i think recently it s gotten on my nerve although i wonder how long i wa ignorant to it just seems like there is nt a much introspective stuff out there anymore
AH no you re just refusing to even attempt to understand the mindset of people in position le fortunate than yours little miss firstworldproblems go live in the dirt for awhile sleep in the dirt eat dirt mixed with cold mres and saltwater deal with asshole that are in charge because they had literally nothing better going for them in their life so they stayed in and got promoted to their level of incompetence cause they were the only one willing to stay go learn pay the price then you ll know
NONE all those successful people you know they fell on their face a bunch of time before they got anywhere some of them just knew the right people or just were born into money that s true but even then a lot of them had to work hard to earn their keep or got plenty of door slammed in their face most successful people are nt going around telling people how much life sucked for x amount of time when thing did nt seem to ever take off people tend to hide the bad part doe nt mean they are nt there
AH are you fucking kidding me i saw a black guy steal a car maybe i should assume all black guy are criminal i saw an asian guy at the casino maybe i should assume all asian are gambling addict i saw a woman smoke some crack maybe all woman smoke crack your one sentence wa enough to pin point how absolutely moronic you really are
NONE i think we are basically in agreement but i am just saying one lucky punch could do massive amount of damage not saying it s more likely just that they only need to get lucky the once it could even be a combination lone wolflarge scale some cdc man or woman self radicalizes and shit could get real ugly
AH i do nt believe i ever said anything about watergate you also have a seriously strange view of what happened there if you read a little closer you ll see that simply i used him a an example of why there s nothing stopping candidate from releasing tax return during an audit nothing more if you really manage to muster all your mental faculty you might even notice that i asked you to explain exactly why an audit would prevent release and you might even notice that you failed to answer along with every other question i asked how embarrassing that s alright we all miss thing at time i ll give you another chance and yes i m entirely in favour of reducing the sway of the popular vote in primary if it were up to me people who were nt able to make it to college a real one not a community college or a state school would nt be able to vote at all
NONE you say that there is no way to know anything but how can you know that really could nt you stumble across a way to know thing some day you can say that you know nothing at the moment but to say that you never knew anything or that you will never know anything seems awfully overconfident so if there is no need for the situation to remain a it is then searching for a way to change the situation may be valid also we regularly make action based on knowledge and logic i need to eat you need to eat so even if you do nt believe in logic you had better act a if you do a minor quibble the logic of an argument is independent of the people speaking it if an argument just popped out of the ether that would nt make it any le valid than if it came out of a person
AH yeah you do nt understand the history of that time at all i do nt really care enough to educate you so well either bask in ignorance or teach yourself
NONE if you want to swear but ca nt bring yourself to do it without censoring yourself think of a better fcking word because we all know what it mean it s not polite it s pathetic
AH have you ever considered the fact that you re kind of stupid people use those accent because that s how the word are pronounced if you ca nt understand there s something wrong with you not with them
NONE may i see some of these rant and are you sure they are nt just fringe case also just saying if someone say they do nt want to have sex with you you kind of do have to bow to that it s called consent
AH what s wrong with steve bannon he s just a small c conservative highly critical of the left and having some medium of notoriety he s not even a race realist nor altright and no not an antisemite either in spite of the fabrication and omission tortuously arranged to make him look a such all in all you re just doing partisan whining like complaining that steve gorsuch is not ruth ginsburg apparently the right wing only ha the right to be left wing what s good for goose is good for gander hereby i charge you with not supporting clarence thomas or antonin scalia in the past how about the left only having the right to be right wing you re just dumb asshole producing transparent hot air
NONE that is a phrase that should nt be offered up a a reason for changing your mind it s simply a statement of prediction or fact i m not going to say that you should get okay with gay marriage just because everyone else is however it is likely a factual statement that year from now the people who are still holding out are going to be looked on very negatively in history book the same way we now look at people who continued to fight against racial equality in the s and beyond that s what it mean to be on the wrong side of history history is written by the victor so when a page in the book is turned you re either on the side that s going to be painted positively or not
AH i believe you misunderstood shock attack with bayonet and cavalry did succeed in four of the five midnineteenth century war except when conducted by american this suggests there wa something different about the american and the evidence doe nt point to them being better marksman than their european counterpart i m not going to bend the fact to make the counterthesis stronger if an informed look at the historical record show it s unlikely for poorly trained and led troop to hit bullseyes they ca nt even see at yard then it s unlikely i take it into account a a possibility but it s a remote possibility that wo nt turn the tide of the battle if you do nt have actual evidence that long range black powder rifle fire from inexperienced militia ha reliably stopped shock attack from professional troop then yeah it wo nt convince me
NONE in regard to your second point about being more likely to start problem i ve noticed just the opposite of course i ca nt speak for everyone but personally i have been berated and assaulted and taken it passively because i wa armed and knew i could nt risk a physical altercation that could escalate to that point the time i ve witnessed a gun used a an intimidation tactic the carrier wa not in legal possession addressing the main thesis and third point briefly it estimated for every confrontation involving someone defending themselves with a gun there are at least more that go unreported this is mostly due to the fact that merely drawing a gun in preparation of defending yourself can often cause a threat to flee and since there wa no actual harm there wa no need to report it admittedly it s anecdotal but so we re talking about time something ha nt happened so there s no way to get hard statistic on that
AH say exactly that to the person now without a job and you ll get smacked in the face
NONE this why i dispise philosopher if it were possible to be anymore up your own as
AH hey there really is nt such a thing a african american culture because all you black come from different country in africa so just shut up and let u take over african american do nt come from other country you fucking idiot the idea that i must justify the existence of white people s culture or various culture and make a case for why it should nt be wiped out is appalling no one is trying to wipe out whatever you think white culture is in fact you just said there is no white culture to begin with
NONE it s just a belief but it could be because of the victim culture that s been created for these group black people and people who live in black neighborhood it make them feel like it s okay to do this since they re victim kinda like how someone hungry feel justified stealing a piece of bread it remove personal responsibility i ve seen a similar thing in my country with a different group of people and no really want to talk about it here because it mean talking about reality kinda like this thread
AH oh that s why you do nt get it you re one of those pseudoscientific people who us logic a a ground to support his arrogance when all you re really doing is basing it all on your own preconceived notion of the world it s all about you which is why you probably do nt believe in alien because human are all sooo special because you re so special and fair warning people who get defensive about being called arrogant those are the arrogant one people who are humble enough to admit that we re all a little arrogant are the one who are nt actually all that arrogant it s a bit paradoxical but eh it s how the ego work
NONE i think you re guilty of the very thing you are deriding here though you re judging their argument by your position in the world simply not believing that these people exist come off a incredibly elitist have you ever even spoken with somebody from deep in the rust belt have you met somebody from a wv mining town besides i do nt see a lot of this cutthroat mathematics among trump fan it doe nt take mathematics for someone from appalachia to figure out that the clinton and the bush do not care about them or their need you re also begging the question here saying that they are nt being rational because they are incapable of it condescension aside that s pretty fallacious
AH so it s okay for a scientist to publish a report that he know is false that link lifesaving medication to the cause of a horrible disease and because of this ton of innocent people die but it just so happened that no one believed him so it s fine right doe nt matter that it could have lead to the death of many people because just randomly people did nt listen to him you realize we already punish act that happened to not cause harm but likely could have take your insulting comment and fuck off
NONE i find it repulsive of course it s going to leave me with a negative impression to me it s the simple fact that they would even desire to hurt a child that disgust me it s not just action that make somebody a bad person obviously i do nt think they should be arrested or anything but i am not going to like them a people and nothing is going to change that look at it this way if somebody really wanted to stab you would nt you hate them regardless of whether or not they actually acted on it
AH do you believe that education should be free and available to all if yes then why not water if no then you re a fucking idiot
NONE i mean yeah pretty much by definition if you do nt want people to see you doing something then you should only do it in private
AH i do nt think his reading comprehension skill are quite up to par
NONE i m clearly a moron but i want to know how is my reasoning wrong
AH the death of over american many of them conscript and million of vietnamese soldier and civilian you forgot that war that it ended in the early s let s imagine a draft being instituted to increase the number of u troop in europe that is nt shit hitting the fan but conscript were used in the korean war the whatchamacallit war and wa lobbied by some in congress during the iraq war so it is nt unimaginable that in the next few decade america is gon na want to put troop somewhere overseas have you heard of isi anyway i still say a draft can include woman it would help keep u troop out of such stupid conflict that you did nt read about in your history book
NONE i do nt think germany wa ever considered the sole villain of ww i mean we call pearl harbor the day to live in infamy and the pacific theatre is taught in u school in europe it s taught much le i know but that s because they really had far le to do with that theatre of the war and you know the nazi invaded most of europe just like how china spends very little time on the european side but cover japan s invasion intently edit if you mean why hitler is such an infamous figure whereas the japanese emperor is not it s likely because of general macarthur propping up the emperor after the war a his figurehead and intentionally shifting the blame elsewhere
AH that s some confusing and irrelevant sophistry you ve barfed out you re aware that it s possible to turn over the executive authority of a company or board to other people while holding public office right that make everything you said invalid and useless
NONE nobody is forcing you to do it but just a it s your right to have the opinion that you should nt do it it s their right to have the opinion that you should and there is no right to be free of the social consequence of having an unpopular view
AH only if that sort of crime becomes frequent enough i have never once in my life heard about gay woman doing this a for men i always just assumed the real men would beat the snot out of any little fag that would try that in a men s room do nt be such a twat
NONE you have a fair view of the world i mean you have a genuine reason to feel the way you do and it s pretty accurate so if you feel unsafe around muslim a a gay man i encourage that you d avoid them if i wa apart of the lgbtq movement i would probably do the same
AH child are nt having their right taken away they are having them suppressed in certain circumstance lol child are not animal obviously but they are not full human yet either lol i do nt know that i ll get you to see this from another perspective so i ll just leave you with this quote many teacher think of child a immature adult it might lead to better and more respectful teaching if we thought of adult a atrophied child keith johnstone
NONE this is nt scientific by any mean but i also look at how many parent choose to have more than one kid not whoop pregnancy but planned there are some couple who stop at child but in my experience most parent choose to have a second i think that speaks volume for how much they must not hate it you know if it wa nothing but work misery and they regretted it deeply they would nt jump straight into having another child a few month or year later
AH i m not a conservative so we can add that to the list of shit you thought you knew jesus you dense cunt i m saying black people which encompass a lot more than the very dark skinned type of people you re saying dark people i am saying i am not attracted to very dark people and i can say that having known myself all my life and having intimate fucking knowledge of my own interest and preference i do nt like asshole i do nt find crazy hair colour attractive i do not find nose piercings attractive i do not like poor hygiene bad teeth or people with very dark skin i do how ever think that there is a world of the most beautiful people to be categorised and would categorise themselves a black
NONE one thing you might want to keep in mind is that bisexual rarely are attracted to both gender equally they tend to have a preference one way or the other this kind of result in a confusion of emotion at time trying to figure out what you really are there are also some issue to face many straight people view you a gay and many gay people view you a a slutty liar also depending on how strong the antigay feeling are where you live you may say to yourself well i do nt want people to know i like dude so i m just going to date girl this often doe nt work out and you may suddenly find yourself in a relationship with a guy you fall for i m not saying being bisexual suck it s pretty great at time but it doe face backlash from others
AH it wa nt intended to be an argument in case you were nt able to comprehend that after reviewing your comment it is clear you would not be worth anyone s time and energy to legitimately debate with just a tad surprised to see normally when someone post something really stupid they re just a troll sadly you re just you enjoy your day though
NONE maybe they do nt know and just think it a cool place to go on holiday maybe they booked a holiday when the place wa le dangerous and have nt been following the news it far better to tell someone just in case they are not aware than worrying that they will feel you are talking down to them it seems pretty insecure to assume a person is being condescending rather than just trying to help
AH i still do nt think it worth spending a decade on over just directly teaching critical thinking the more you argue this the more i think you need it
NONE i m actually doing a good amount of research on this topic right now but i do nt really have anything to contribute just commenting so i can read the response later
AH prove it butthurt goptard
NONE or better yet not at all
AH it s amazing how you read sometimes a always i d suggest you go back to school and work on reading comprehension
NONE doe wwwcodecademycom work on your phone also it might help you to write and instead of n it s much more readable
AH fact your subjective experience is irrelevant you re saying there is no risk and opportunity in germany why what are you basing this off of you re making retarded claim and think saying i moved to the u justifies them whatsoever sad
NONE if you need an afterlife to scare you into not murdering people then your moral probably are nt motivated by the right reason you do nt steal because god is watching really that s it let s say god take a day off now is it alright
AH are you retarded shooting blank mean ejaculating with no nor not viable sperm aka a gun shooting blank round
NONE the idea of a simulation is interesting but unfalsifiable it ca nt be proven right or wrong so why bother trying
AH doe nt realize that running away when thug are chasing and yelling at you is a smart thing to do think he s smarter than a judge
NONE i do nt think trump is the kind of guy who feel any need to follow through on anything he say much le campaign promise
AH http everydayfeminismcomreverseoppressioncantexist http everydayfeminismcomsexismvsprejudice they also title it a derailing a in men s concern are just derailing the conversation again proving my point i honestly do nt know what you re trying to get at with this analogy in many case the men who are perpetuating the patriarchy are nt even necessarily the same one being harmed by it is nt it more like some men hitting other men and even that miss part of my point becaues it also men hitting woman woman hitting men and woman hitting other woman the whole point is it affect everybody and is perpetuated by people of both gender given that the invogue explanation for men s problem is toxic masculinity no under the system of patriarchy by the way woman have little to no power under men and influencing their norm this is how topdown conception of power hierarchy work i can give you plenty of reading material on this basis here s an article on a feminist website that is literally about how most feminist do nt hate men http everydayfeminismcomfeministsdonthatemenderail i m not necessarily endorsing or agreeing with everything in this article but if you read it a dripping with disdain for men i m pretty sure the problem is with you not the article or feminism also fuck off
NONE can somebody please define for me just what these moron think patriarchy mean it s not like there is some underlying force that drive people or men to do anything everything i hear a patriarchy simply refers to a statisitically aggregate phenomenon usually by cherrypicking the phenomenon for example that most of the people at the top of society are men sure but most of the people at the bottom of society are men too a homeless white man is not more privileged than say oprah winfrey do men regulalrly plow into people in the street seems to me a far a social pressure it is for men to be chivilrous let woman go first open door for woman and otherwise treat them with dignity and preferential treatment if she wanted to change that perhaps she should berate men when they do those thing of course it will have no effect and just result in everybody thinking she s an asshole a well but perhaps thinking of woman a social asshole instead of putting them on a pedestal is a possible goal for equality except that most people are generally nice to everybody i ca nt fathom how she think doing this is of any value to anybody is modern feminist theory really just a mean to make woman look like prilieged entitled whiny asshole what a horrible vision
AH oh for fuck s sake being rude and ragey ha nothing to do with her fucking skin color it wa nt about her being black it wa about her being a bitch about it and no saying that you do nt respect someone s behavior is not disrespectful it s honest i ca nt stand either one of those two but i am sick to death of everything being made about race whether it really is or not her skin color is nt what made her comment angry and bitchy her attitude is
NONE i do nt think you understand what a hypocrite is if she wa judging other woman while being slutty herself maybe you d have a point the slut moniker meaningless by the way wa heaped on her and she never used it a a negative for anyone else from what i could see even if she had been fucking every boy in the school and lying abuot it to bill and ben that still doe nt make her a hypocrite
AH once again you prove that you have no ability to distinguish between presidential skill at achieving his objective and politics you re in favor of that seems to be much of your argument a well it seems maybe we both consider specific action and inaction more politically valuable than others thus do nt see eye to eye i m done wasting my time on a child well i hope you have a nice day then i would be glad to have an in depth policy conversation another day
NONE i do nt think i can change your view without giving you a whole course in economics every corner of your argument here relies on a foundation of economic falsehood i m not trying to insult you i just want you to be aware that that could be a possibility hopefully someone with greater enthusiasm and time who is wellversed in economics can give a lengthy counterpoint here but i wo nt be the one to do it
AH it would nt matter if he did or not you have to make a clear case that renting to a rich black doctor will someone cause this invasion of crime
NONE and if someone ha a true belief and it is shown to a reasonable standard to be wrong with evidence would nt it be good if they did nt change their mind
AH i really ca nt hear your argument through all your doublingdown on your baseless assumption and appeal to tradition
NONE it s not so much that i want to change your opinion that i want to convince you not to bring this up in polite company
AH why ca nt you just fucking talk about the topic you decided to comment on why are you so hung up on formality and not even a bit on the topic this is arrogant still i wa nt false but you obviously have no intention on getting on with the real argument
NONE you mentioned that if you show up late to a thread or post a conflicting viewpoint you get shoved to the bottom and forgotten i think you re kinda missing the point of everyone s complaint it s not that everyone is worried not being heard it s about not being able to speak
AH whew look at the debating skill on this one
NONE this comment is pretty much spot on i think
AH nope source on that it is nt hard to make george bush look bad george bush did a pretty good job of making george bush look bad so there is nt any reason to lie to make him look bad there s plenty of true thing one could say about bush that would be equally demeaning i do nt buy it ndt is nt a prick you re just part of the hive mind
NONE what would you say would make someone not great a predictable mistake that cost his country million of life is nt enough neither is murdering a fair number of his own people if those two thing are nt enough to make you feel like he wa nt a great leader i feel like you re just opposed to changing your view
AH ok prove it and his wife who said that in ya know before he won the nomination wa a paid clinton supporter right or the people who are still accusing him i suppose the clinton are still paying them the end goal can be the same thing sure thank you and i will ask again please defend penny on his pro lgbt stance why wo nt you do that oh probably because you ca nt it doe nt need to be logical or based on any reasoning beyond just feeling to change reality much like you saying the constitution doe nt include islam lmao who s not in reality again the person who is interpreting something never written down in the constitution lmao wow it s so obvious you have no idea what you re talking about am i talking to trump because you seem to think jefferson capitulated to isi or something wow and you have no idea of history once again point out a person in that age who did nt own or have family that did nt own slave that wa the time he lived in he also had his view changed do to his exposure to slave like his wife s half sister he defended black and even had an idea near his death bed by ending slavery in the u by buying slave child and freeing them for all their short coming a founder is a founder you re an idiot
NONE well i would nt want her in the changing room with my kid i also think that once paul made agreement with his wife to be married and raise a family he should do just that i think it s selfish of him to just up and leave a bunch of kid if he wanted to transition and stay at the house helping with the kid in a responsible manner great but just deciding suddenly that he want to be a child is inappropriate in my opinion from the wiccan rede an ye harm none do what ye will he is harming his child by what he is doing whether or not he is harming his wife only she know i also think that he is hurting the lbgtq community and promoting pedophilia by his action how can people on the fence about transgendered people take it seriously with him parading around in dress pretending to be a little girl alternately if he is serious those who are penetrating him are taking advantage of his mental illness back in the late it seemed like there wa this big competition to see who could get more wasted nowadays it s a big competition to see who can be more sexually out there i thought it wa stupid then and i think it s stupid now it doe nt help people who are truly transgender or homosexual to have a bunch of people playing at it to try to be unique give it a rest already edit i believe that a year old thinking they are a child is a mental illness
AH any business transaction requires voluntary consent on both side no buyer or seller should be coerced into a business transaction against their will that is simply wrong you retard would force a black artist to paint a white supremacy poster for the kkk
NONE but now you re dictating what other people s utility function should be if my satisfaction with a purchase depends on knowing i got a discount then it s information that need to be disclosed honestly for a transparent transaction that maximises utility
AH so you want to challenge it on a morality basis that s fine but on a moral basis i ll champion equal right and nondiscrimination and you can squawk about singed sensibility that are cherrypicked from an old book however case law doe not automatically make it right since case law also state under korematsu v united state that it s completely fine to order american based on certain trait into internment camp regardless of citizenship you re arguing interpretation of the constitution you keep citing the st and th amendment if you re going to cite them a some overarching standard to which one must adhere you re obliged to also acknowledge the interpretation of the same and the authority on the constitution in this country happens to be the supreme court of the united state if you want to state the amendment so fervently in other word you ca nt just ignore what they re generally agreed to protect or not protect which still doe not refute the hypocrisydouble standard since the example i pointed out can also be considered compelling or essential interest a well also this same logic wa used in korematsu v united state korematsu ha officially been acknowledged to have been in error a of so there s that http articleslatimescommaynationlanajapaneseamericans wherein you re essentially saying that you are perfectly comfortable with forced association and involuntary servitude however i m sure people like yourself back then were perfectly comfortable with the governmentstate putting japanese american into interment camp you re full of it and a troll not a single concrete example beyond korematsu which is fundamentally flawed and ha since been acknowledged by the party to the case to have been in error keep on spamming those same argument and telling yourself you are nt a bigot bye
NONE first i have to ask why is this presented a a quasipartisan issue based on the below and the example you give it seems that your primary view in this case is about how people should respond to speech they oppose presumably you are equally opposed to effort to pressure that wackjob state rep in missouri to resign after saying trump should be assassinated or the firing of kathy griffin after she made that video of trump s decapitation a you are to the boston rally or the delisting of the daily stormer to the extent you are nt i d be interested in why you are not to the extent that you are i think it at the very least undermines the idea that this is primarily about leftist liberal more generally or democrat a someone who largely agrees with you in term of the need for a culture of free speech especially free from getting fired for expressing unpopular view i think that making it partisan only hurt effort to change that culture to the extent the view you want changed is what you articulate below that there should be no nonverbal consequence for speech i have to ask what your ideal world would look like saying that there should be more protection in place for being fired based on politicalsocial view is one thing asking that people not counterprotest a rally that includes conspiracy theorist and the founder of the militant highlymasculine group will be the ‘ tactical defensive arm ’ of the proud boy http wwwbostonglobecommetrospeakerslistforbostonfreespeechrallyincluderightwingextremistxwnzhzwrjqsvorbpnnpstoryhtml is quite different also it s worth noting that galileo wa persecuted by the state via it s religious arm while it certainly should serve a a warning to everyone about the danger of oppressing unpopular view if the first amendment s speech protection applied what happened to galileo would not have been possible
AH i m a geneticist whose phd thesis wa on the regulation of sexual dimorphism at the cellular level i pretty much have the topic down i try not to engage with people like you because i find that a a general rule people who read science without understanding it then pontificate are not educable but for the benefit of anyone else reading i feel compelled to leave a nope here
NONE i know this is a day old but i wanted to say i agree with your view it something i think about a lot but i wanted to ask if you agree with the popular opinion on what is right and wrong for example i agree with the basic stance on good and bad i just simply understand that they are just majority opinion slavery wa nt wrong in the eye of the public until the majority believed it to be
AH i m not being arrogant i am being factual it s important in conversation like this to be precise the ego is in somebody like you trying to be condescending and talk down to me instead of trying to provide an argument without the data i outlined any conclusion of sexism is a huge leap unsupported by what s there that s a plain and simple fact your ad hominem attack show you do nt have anything of value to add and your ego demanded you get your two cent on stop projecting your bullshit onto mee
NONE well i do nt know the movie you re referring to so i ca nt defend particular point but i do nt think you have to be able to summarize the main point to bet the sense that someone is on your side in a struggle or that they feel a common emotion with you simple word choice can have a huge impact on the tone of a piece regardless of the sentence structure add together enough word that resonate with someone and a tone of speech that is sincere or powerful and you can get people to cheer for anything
AH thanks for proving my point above that you re all a threat to the american way the american way whatever that mean ha failed this egalitarian experiment ha failed extending the franchise to woman wa the nail in the coffin we re on a deterministic path towards balkanization fiscal collapse and civil war you can stay deluded if you like intelligent people are waking up getting organized and preparing you your wife s son can get genocided in aztlan for all i care
NONE but i do believe that support network should be established for former prisoner even to a degree for people who might be getting shunned or exiled but if you have actively shunned for over a year it s very very hard to let go of that the emotion are still going to be there the point of my reply wa that the shunning and exclusion from society are a massive part of the problem with our system of judgement arguably the worst part and that it should nt be reinforced
AH so i m gon na miss out on your history lesson on the reason for the second amendment that s disappointing i m not afraid of people because i m not a little bitch i do nt need to carry a gun everywhere i go for that reason

AH did you create this thread to have a discussion or just so you could snarkily make fun of everyone who post in it ad hominem is when you attack your opponent rather than your opponent position that did nt happen do nt just throw out term from your philosophy textbook if you do nt understand what they mean i wa going to respond more to this but you have literally refuted nothing here and just casually dismissed everything in a pretty douchey way i should add and in some case outright strawmanned my argument andor made no attempt to actually read the word i typed yeah slavery too you must have been the star of your high school debate team this is nt what the cmv subreddit is for see ya
NONE if you re talking about it like it wa a done deal but it wa nt it doe nt really add anything to your argument because it wa proposed and rejected it did nt happen you ca nt just say that something that wa proposed and than rejected support your claim the other point you made do nt make any sense zero they mean something because you claim they mean something the really do nt mean a thing on their own you seem to have already come to your conclusion i ve made valid point and you have simply responded with however or that doe make sense but i fail to see how this is worth my time when it seems to me that you have already made up you final conclusion good luck with this one i ve said my piece
AH so your argument is that the only sex allowed is purely for procreation and no human being who ha ever lived ha ever had sex for any other reason either you know there is such a thing a casual sex in which case you know you re full of shit or you do nt know in which case you re completely out of touch with reality
NONE i completely agree with your view here but i feel like that s because your three way to look at gender is unfair can you find me someonesome source where they actually believe there are three a opposed to two or one or in a loose sense oneandahalf facet to sexgender i ve never seen anyone claim that before
AH why do you people always have to come in here and behave like troll what do you get out of this

NONE because you find this mistake to be so egregious one that they do deserve to die also i think saying that you personally have a hard time with sympathy is a little different from saying that they do nt deserve sympathy the latter implies that other people should nt feel sympathy a well
AH all thing considered i would suggest instead that fuck you for supporting op in being a shitgibbon your post is apprenticelevel shitgibbonry
NONE the only merit i can see for this post is self confirmation best guess is that you want a phd or are going for one if so good for you otherwise what is the purpose of the post
AH why should i even be expected to learn the difference though and even when i am trying some smug smarta on the internet belittles me this is practically a doctorate in gender theory to me because half the time i literally do nt know what you re talking about i mean how do change every chromosome in your body and if you do nt how can you consider the sex changed
NONE i tried looking up appenion on google simply just by typing in the word and nothing came up but the word appenion in order to look up how to spell something you kind of need to know how to spell it that s probably really difficult for people with extreme spelling problem like you are mentioning to therefore look up word it doe nt necessarily mean they do nt care

AH a fptp voting system is gon na generally lead to two party because large party that cooperate have more success in that system this is nt a voter problem it is nt going to be solved by voting for nonviable candidate it also wont be solved by voting for people who rely on fptp to keep their power so pretending you should nt vote third party because it wont help the political system is dishonest when the people you are arguing people should vote for are the one who ensure the broken system stay in place whether being a democratic leader mean they should nt be otherthrown that s just absurdly idiotic other country are allowed to elect whoever the hell they want and the usa should have no right to remove them unless you also agree china and russia should be allowed to invade the usa kill your leader murder a couple hundred thousand inncoent civilian and demolish all the infrastructure but no with insane nationalist it s always one rule for our action and another completely different rule for everyone else
NONE your proposed system is undemocratic it s random temporary oligarchy legislator would have zero responsibility or incentive to do anything their constituent want them to do they never had to listen to voter concern or even become familiar with the issue and process to win an election and they are already lame duck when they re sworn in if you re someone who need the government to do something there is no one you can expect to listen to your grievance and find some way to help you because no one in this system ha any reason to care what you think except maybe out of the kindness of their heart no one represents you there are a lot of problem with the way that voter choose their leader in the first past the post system but at least the voter choose their leader and therefore the leader are responsive to the voter concern first past the post should be replaced with a system that make the government more responsive to it constituent not a system that abolishes it responsibility altogether
AH more authority lol dude the priest s punch is making you loopy you ca nt be bothered to read the whole bible astounding right though jesus talk all about abortion huh wayyyy more than never orr the natural culling of offspring is nt mentioned at all because it s a foundational part of nearly all living organism reproductive process we re living in a poignant example of what happens when you scramble to save them all there s too many people on earth a it is by a lot and you wan na force poor young girl to keep one they did nt ask for just so you feel better about the world i m missing the outcome of those scenario where you actually take in unwanted rape child yourself not just bitch and moan about how many poor unborn baby are nt going to get to have the terrible life they should have had with a mother who wa too young or parent that resent your very existence despicable friend if you knew a modicum about the bible or spirituality on the whole you d know that catholicism is a drastic aberration from god truth a bastardized amalgamation of money grubbing and those poor poor horny old men you guy only care about child in the womb after they re born you just send em right on down to father john for their first fiddling better yet start with reading a basic history of catholicism first some good point font easy on the eye then move on the actual bible plz and thank you do nt convert me agnostic
NONE two men walk into a bar one is an atheist one a theist they both order a drink they both drink it they both leave year later they both die who enjoyed their drink more the problem is how you are viewing another person s life understand that you view their life from the outside you see their whole life a having believed in god and had a more fulfilling life for it they have nt they are living just the way you are a construct of a higher power or not they are living at a rate of one second per second they do nt think every second on the second man sure is a great day to look forward to death because i have an afterlife waiting for me when they stub their toe it hurt just like it doe for you they ll curse the furniture like you do rearrange the living room some day just like you will stub their toe again just like you will each moment is the same for the both of you neither one of you are contemplating your death and life and their meaning you re just trying to get your toe to stop throbbing that or your misconception is about which life is being fulfilled more is their life more fulfilled because they believed in god the whole time or because they re in heaven afterwards because if it s the latter i have news for you you believe in god i do nt think we re here for anything we re just product of evolution you can say gee your life must be pretty bleak if you do nt think there s a purpose but i m anticipating a good lunch dr james watson
AH when the behaviour encouraged and demanded by a sub cruelty spill outside that sub you really think it ha nothing to do with that sub mate that s not going to work with anyone who ha finished high school reddit ha publicly announced it is not a free speech platform it never will be so leave that s the only thing a principled person such a yourself can do with a website opposed to free expression on the internet if you truly believe what reddit ha publicly stated it is is wrong there s the door i net your principle are nt a strong a you argue they are
NONE what is a universal right is this a right that everyone ha or that everyone should have it seems to me that there is no such thingas a universal right right are derived from an agreement between government and the governed either can apply pressure to add or restrict right we ve seen this time and time again throughout history i think what you mean is that it ought to be a universally accepted right and i think there is no way to for a moral person to argue against it many people will though and it is never likely to be a universally recognized right because most people feel that money is worth more than people
AH what benefit would being dead bring if life is all pointless and being dead is also pointless why ca nt i stay alive despite being a slave to my genetic code i enjoy according to the brain i m enslaved by the stuff i do while alive and want to continue it you re just answering every point with huuuur it s pointless though so i do nt expect a reasonable or sane response you have nt stumbled across some great realisation you just sound ridiculous you are welcome to kill yourself to avoid any future suffering if you want but since currently my life seems to be more enjoyable than painful i m not going to
NONE for the record i completely agree with your view the issue is that it s essentially impossible to argue for it without the inevitable slippery slope my goto a argument is about inmate personally i d rather die than serve life in prison not that i m actually worried about that pretty much the only thing keeping me alive at all right now is my incredible wife if she dy fuck it i m out i do nt want anyone else and i m pretty sure i would nt want to even feel happiness again without her to share it i am both of sound mind and body and like you said did not choose to be here
AH honestly i still think you are probably insane aslong a you are happy and not the source of conflict to people around you i have no issue with we you want to dobe i like how you list literal thing that are the coin for lableing people a insane and trying to pas them off a totally normal mental state jk thats insane but hey if i can say im a female and everyone else is a nazi for questioning me clearly theyre the insane one right cu nazi etc again if you are happy and the people around you arent unhappy or suffering distress by all mean you do you
NONE i will assume you hold antiquard beleifs untill such time a you deny them after that ill just think you are an imbicile for not undestanding your scripture this is basically you just being a jerk to people lot of people have wrong view about lot of thing but treating them a if they re generally stupid because they hold a belief that you disagree with is just jerky even if you have strong reason to think they re wrong people being jerk to each other is bad for a whole host of reason and you should nt do it
AH contrary to popular belief your inability to realize the difference between a friendly hello and sexual assault is disturbing the fact that you think anyone should be ticketed for saying hello is absurd you have serious mental issue if you think you should be allowed to use the government to punish people for saying hello the fact that you ca nt comprehend the fact that somebody saying hello to you is nt trying to force fuck you in the middle of the street is a sign of a mental problem that should be dealt with immediately it should not be a crime to say hello to somebody it should not be a crime to tell a stranger you find them beautiful either the fact that you do nt seem to realize the difference between somebody giving a compliment and somebody trying to rape you is your fault your mental issue your insanity it sound like you have an irrational fear of men who dare say hello to a stranger also how do you prove you were harassed you can not your word is not enough to punish somebody with the law the fact that you want to stigmatize men for saying hello putting them on some sort of sex registry a sexual harasser is fucking insane wholesale insane
NONE there is a role for parenting when it come to giving child and adolescent a much truth a they can comprehend and assimilate in a healthy way for example if i wa trying to teach a young child about the police i would tell them that the police are your friend and there to help you if you ever need help this is a gross oversimplification but a child doe nt have the nuance necessary for more if i wa talking to a year old about the police i would say the police are there to protect society and everyone but they might not always be trying to help you it is important that you are respectful to them because they are doing an important job and if you are rude to them they will get angry with you and can do a lot to make your life much much much harder than it should be but it is also important that if you feel like the police are accusing you of something you ask to call a me and a lawyer so whenever the police ask you to do something you say yes sir and you do it but if they are asking you question or want to search you ask for a lawyer and your parent with an adult we can talk about the abuse and bad police out there because we understand time out of a thousand if you are polite and helpful with the police you will come out ok if you are not a criminal anyways but i would nt want to put that in the mind of a kid or even a year old because i think it would give them a le correct view of the world than the one i just said
AH i did nt even know the derek zoolander center for child who ca nt read good and wan na learn to do other stuff good too had a med program very nice but seriously though a the owner of a master of science degree to someone who is in med school just sit back and think about it think about what need to exist to constitute rape and rape culture rape culture is some new term to make sure someone somewhere is being oppressed so we all have something to bitch about this narrative ha made it so easy for innocent life to be wrecked and trampled for being a rapist when they are nothing of the sort i m not claiming that there are nt actual rapist walking free but i am claiming that most rape is nt rape edit punctuation thanks android
NONE first rape can and doe result in death in some case but that is nt the point surviving something doe not necessarily mean it ha to result in imminent death rape kill soul that is nt being dramatic that is reality for many people who ve been raped rape doe not have to be compared to everything else to determine if it s bad enough to warrant a specific term i survived my rape my rapist s intention wa to take my life figuratively possibly literally how do i know he said so my rape came at a time when i wa already dealing with major depression and i very nearly took my own life after and probably would have had it not been for someone who intervened who are you to tell me i m not a survivor i sure a hell am no victim
AH oh jeez i did nt realize you were delusional go masterbate on your own
NONE i agree with absolutely everything you said explained and described i think you re right

AH being color blind doe not mean you ca nt admit that racism exists all it mean is you personally do nt give a shit about other people s race basically you re trying to twist what being color blind is from teh obvious definition into a stupid one that only an idiot could have and frankly i m not sure why you re trying to do that
NONE it s also like saying that airplane would never work a many smart people did back then i m an atheist too but saying my argument is like religion is just an insult not an argument if you re going to say something is impossible you have to have a reason why you think that physic wo nt allow something to happen in the universe
AH oh no i have a place to live but want to find people to pay me for my other place to live that i do nt need and it s so hard

AH this logic is hard to argue with bc it so stupid ok so to keep me out of debt you want to charge me for something i ca nt afford or financially penalize me no just no look if it s in the national interest it should be taxed and paid for that way charging a fee doesnt solve debt or death i think you might be retarded the aca doe nt charge for your healthcare it s cheaper than getting sick but if you ca nt afford healthcare you should be fighting to have the price reduced not fighting to be exempt from the service people who were happy with their previous coverage which wa cheaper typically had incomplete coverage with maximum payouts below the average cost for medical treatment meaning effectively there were a large number of people with no real coverage did you get lung cancer oh dear that treatment is going to cost over the next year that s above our maximum so we are nt going to pay but you can thank your decision to save money on healthcare for your month prognosis for someone in the uk getting cancer cost nothing extra we all pay in to the nh and we all get the treatment we need unless of course conservative twat cut the fucking funding cripple the industry on purpose then blame the lack of nurse on liberal you should be fighting harder for your healthcare premium to go down under the aca and a higher minimum wage not trying to gut the system because you d rather die than live in a country that look after it citizen
NONE a couple thing the u can have b debt not because we have the strongest fighting force in the world might be part of the reason the main reason that i see is that the u had m people a well a about mil mi of land that it can collect tax on it is the same reason you can buy a house that is way more than your yearly income while you might not be good for the money the house still is the u debt to gdp ratio is about which is a pretty big deal you do nt run into problem until you hit when you re debtinterest payment become to much for you to pay japan is currently having that problem every year they borrow more by than their economy grows so they can never get out from under it secondly you make a point that you need to cut welfare because it is essentially providing you something when you can not provide society something welfare is supposed to be a social safety net so that when you fall on hard time the government will help you out in hope that you will someday be able to rise back up and pay your share of tax this promotes risk taking and that is good for the economy because you know that while your life will suck for the next several year with hard work you can get out of it you re going to be more willing to quit your day job and start your own business or finish working on your invention or whatever it is tl dr the amount of money we owe is nt to bad unless we stop growing economically and welfare is good because social safety net help the economy grow
AH i d argue that not teaching religion is effectively teaching atheism yep we have just entered retard vill
NONE it should be taught when they are learning intro to psychology because religion is delusional insanity

AH when people in the west ie people on reddit talk about modern feminism they mean feminism in their own culture not in some foreign country that we have almost zero cultural exchange with b you just made that up in retrospect millenial feminist will be remember a so you are not only a spokesperson for the west ie reddit is the west but also a visionary able to you do nt know what retrospect mean right racist and you ca nt even read what a package
NONE if i changed your view make sure to award a delta detail are in the sidebar if you have no clue what i m talking about but yeah your view here seems pretty similar to the whole colourblindness idea where some people think if we just forget about race than racism will go away that view is great if there wa nt any racism to begin with but in a world where there s clear racism that s targeted at specific group forgetting about race and therefore racism really just argues for the status quo

NONE i ca nt change your view exactly what i can do is tell you that there are other option what you re really looking at here is a problem with western culture you re one of million of men who have come to this conclusion it s not woman who are the problem it s the government that constantly pander to woman human nature being what it is mean that a a male once you sign on the dotted line you re always going to be at risk of falling prey to the government s new rule and any given woman s spite that doe nt mean most of even any sizable number of woman are going to set their sight on screwing you over in some way it just mean that since it only take one and you re not allowed to play the game only lose it it s not worth the trouble so instead of worrying about these problem consider finding a woman from a different culture better still go to a different country and find a wife there that s what i did and for exactly the same reason you cite in your post there are no guarantee this way either but considering your only guarantee otherwise involve you grabbing your ankle i d say it s worth your time to at least consider

AH i m probably a selfish asshole for thinking this way but i really think trump being president would be entertaining i ve never thought this about anyone before but i really do nt think you should have the right to vote it s one thing to support someone and not fully understand them or only kind of follow politics or something but if you think it s all a big joke and it would be funny to have an idiot run the country you really are a shitty person in my opinion if you vote you should not vote at all in this case which is a position i never thought i would take
NONE i think the best way i can put it is that while deism doe answer the how of the universe better it is nt about having a belief in how the universe came to be personally and for i think a lot of atheist it is alright to not know or put differently i would rather accept that i do nt know until such a time a i can know deism is a form of choosing to know something without proof faith but why do we need to have an answer the answer of i do nt know is in my opinion better than choosing a potentially sub par answer if any of this rambling make sense
AH i do nt think it s helpful to shove the gay culture down people s throat by putting on a big flamboyant parade i m not homosexual but i think that is exactly what we should be doing i think it is helpful for so called straight whatever the hell that s supposed to mean to be included in lgbt community celebration if you feel embarrassed by flamboyant gay men that is most likely a reflection of your own internalized homophobia i doubt you feel the same about dyke on bike in the parade funny is nt it if we all just went back to keeping our sexuality to our bedroom radical would have nothing to protest about my god i just the ignorance is so massive i do nt know where to start i think it s just ridiculous to have a parade to show how proud you are that you like dick fuck you how dare you assume that the reason for being in a gay pride parade is to display one s gay male sexuality you know just fuck you
NONE i d like to say i disagree with you op but i do nt closeted bi guy and a stagehand i ve worked several of these big gay shindig and in all honesty there s x a much in the dark corner fucking going on than even a sex club i ve been in in the south this is all anecdotal to my experience of course i ll go one step further with what i know will be downvote and hate bait but i ve always considered the stereotypical lisspy oh my god here they come making noise gay guy to be the biggest set back to gay right i know it s just who they are and should nt be judged but those are the one setting all the nasty stereotype that drive biggots to hate even more it s not their fault sure but anyone who purposely draw that much attention to themselves should be socially aware of just who they are and what their action cause just a walking spectacle of look how much i claim to not give a fuck about what you think

NONE heartless that s not at all what i wa saying honestly it s hard not to argue strawman when you re not entirely sure what the other person is trying to communicate but i wa saying that i think you re underestimating the people you were talking about everybody realizes they do nt matter and everybody ha been realizing that for quite a while now usually pretty early in their life why would that universal feeling suddenly spawn a person protest there would have had to be more to it than that like government corruption and systemic inequality and unethical financial practice and the factor you can easily read about if you so much a look at the wikipedia page at least i think that s what you mean by the wa people realising they do not matter you mean the feeling of being powerless a an individual right probably mixed with some unearned entitlement not the knowledge of being le powerful due to the inequality that exists in the u democraticcapitalist governmenteconomic system and the conclusion that such a system is unjust
AH that wa nt even the original statement to deduce from yes it wa my original statement wa with great wealth come great responsibility and from great wealth you embarrassingly deduced i understand you well but it is my duty a an intellectual to cover all basis when it come to an argument you are not an intellectual however if you were an intellectual it would be your duty to not intentionally misrepresent someone since you have just now admitted that you understood what i meant by great wealth you have therefor admitted that you intentionally misrepresented my word
NONE your opinion is changed waaaaay too easily that argument only follows if the statement is meant to imply retarded people get this wrong of the time and you will get it wrong iff you are retarded if you were normal you would have answered correctly the statement that answer wa retarded and variation thereof simply mean that the answer wa so dumb it had to come from a disabled mind just a if you did nt see the post you walked into you must be blind the implication is nt that all retarded people would give such a foolish answer but that all answer that foolish are given by retarded people see the difference

AH i really doubt he s talking about thing like weed or alcohol what make you think i m talking about weed and alcohol there s really no such thing a a casual meth user and you know it you have absolutely no idea what you re talking about i think you d be shocked if you actually knew how few drug user are actually addict http archivesamhsagovdataknewusedependnewusedependhtm claim like that are the perfect illustration of the both the ignorance of most people about the actual danger of drug and the effectiveness of propaganda designed to perpetuate bad policy
NONE so you do nt agree that people are looking for a conformation bias of sort to make them feel like it s okay to get high when all they do is talk about getting high or is that more just them a a person i do nt know it depends on the person i m sure some people talk about it nonstop just to look for enablers supporter while others really rather do nothing other than smoke pot can think of no better topic though going back to the main point i do think it s totally ok when several other criterion are met though in my experience more often than not all of that other criterion is not met

AH care is available to anyone who seek it especially poor people no poor pregnant woman in this country will ever be denied medical care ever i ve seen it on a firsthand basis for a long long time do you really think all these inner city or rural poor people are just saint getting turned away at the doctor s office do you think they are calling around trying to find a provider who will see them do you think they take prescription to the pharmacy and are told they ca nt get the drug no this is nt how it work these people are generally lazy and will not go to a doctor at all even when it is free and they have transportation what experience do you have with healthcare you are just buying what the liberal medium tell you any time the government or socialism interferes with medicine it fails miserably how old are you what experience do you have with underserved population i see you apparently got your md from google university
NONE while you have a responsibility a a healthcare worker i do nt think we can expect people to risk their life when the job normally is rather lowrisk some of these nurse and doctor are maybe single parent leaving behind kid or something like that they would probably not want to risk their life and risk leaving their child alone it s hard to judge people s action without having the full picture a long a we have people who are willing to work with the patient i do nt think we should force other people to do it yes the hospital in the article have to call in nurse from elsewhere but at least that s possible i could see the reason to use financial force if nobody wa willing to work there if nobody treat the patient and they just run around spreading disease we could have a large epidemic on our hand but let not force people before it s necessary also if you feel like someone in this thread ha swayed your view in one way or another you should award them delta

NONE i did nt mean to suggest an equivalence just to say that efficacy is unrelated to ethic i m pretty sure i ve engaged in something that count though i think it different between friend a opposed to strangersthe bar scene light teasing among friend who might hook up eventually is contextualized by preexisting trust but i do nt want to make a categorical judgement the volent video game thing is an interesting comparison i think the differentiator is that people do absorb social more from the people they hang out with and talk to there s not really evidence for that being the case for video game or medium consumption not sure why anyways i am not sure i m prepared to say the method are morally wrong but i ll stand by saying that socializing on trp is bad for one s view of woman you yourself say you need to ignore the sexist stuff and i m sure people can do that but for someone young who already think they do nt get woman i do nt know if it s the best way to get this advice really your post here is a pretty good chunk of advice written clearly and more respectfully than the discussion on trp maybe people should just read that

NONE it make small compliment meaningless because you d say them all the time anyways i disagree i think small compliment are most meaningful when reinforced again and again being an adult person in the world is a difficult and deflating thing much of the time to have someone in your corner who will remind you again and again that you are worthy is a powerful thing they most likeley know it s just positive reenforcement and not your actual opinion about of the time wich tell them absoluteley nothing it tell them that you are interested in their wellbeing let s say you re in a boring relationship and your so keep cry about you re gon na break up with me are nt you this is a good example of when not to lie because the lie in this instance i am not going to break up with you is the hurtful thing in the long run not all lie are like this anyway you re not likely to have an opinion about most thing when someone asks you whether you like their sweater it s not a though you have a longconsidered opinion about it you re forming an opinion a you re giving it the thing you say are more than their literal meaning that s a bad haircut communicates your opinion about haircut but also communicates the position of this post namely that you do nt believe you ought to be responsible for how your word make others feel i think you are mistaken to imagine that this will win you others respect
AH yes that is the typical idiotic response for this
NONE this is exactly the argument i wa about to make
AH yeah i answered these question over and over in this thread and i do nt know how many time i have to repeat myself you are overall downplaying what every other people are going through and only pointing out the hardship black people have and claiming they have zero fault in this it s childish
NONE i wo nt try to change your view because i share your view they are some of the most horrible people i ve ever known constantly telling other people what to think and feel and how to live their life also i can not socialize with people who are overly sensitive so you will never see me hanging out with an sjw
AH i m just not going to waste any more time on a regressive little pissant like you

AH did you look into the veracity of this statement before you allowed it to be read by other people though michelangelo wa commissioned for the work it wa absolutely a work of his own imagining he wa asked to do one thing and he proposed doing another he might have not wanted to do the work in the first place but what he made wa absolutely a piece of art of his own creation personally i feel disdain for any artistmusician that doe not write their own work but i can see how one would still be able to call them an artistmusician
NONE if all that s happened wa that a man asked a woman out three time over the course of three week and she did nt let him know she wa not interested you re probably right but you re only hearing his side of a story that happened yearsdecades ago neither of those factor point to the information being particularly trustworthy people subconsciously change their memory and do not want to tell people thing that cast them in a negative light so the best thing to do when such a story sound strangeunbelievable is to reserve judgment
AH the fact that you suggest that indicates you did nt bother to read what i wrote in the slightest either that or you lack even a modicum of reading comprehension which actually would make sense i really got ta go with neither if you are nt suggesting that aave is a speech impediment then you re saying that mocking other dialect is completely fine which really make you the total dick when you think about it that response make no sense in the context it wa used let me just quote you real quick why should i believe anything from you after you have repeatedly proven yourself both rude and entirely lacking a point i m suggesting that you are correct that i am rude but have yet to prove anything one way or the other about the actual content of your post the clue is that i wa replying directly to the above yes i do really because it doe nt look like you do given that you sidestep any way to show that understand what a premise is and previously airquoted it a if premise are not what argument are made of you ve just bloviated to disguise your ignorance
NONE so in your own post you quote pretty much everything i said why what wa the purpose of quoting me i know what i said the whole thing feel vaguely insulting a if i would nt know what you re talking about unless you told me i understand that s not your point but arguing with someone is substantially more about emotion than reason back to the quoteresponse formula generally it look something like this thing i said why reason specific thing i said is wrong another thing i sad another reason why specific thing is wrong more of my reasoning yet more specific response to that specific reasoning this can go on for a while but what this immediately tell me and i m guessing many others since those who see it are le persuaded is that the person responding to me is nt considering my post a a whole and is nt interested in really understanding what i m saying the interest is more in being right than anything else and someone so fixated on being right is nt open to having their view changed also post like this seem more like a take down than an attempt to understand and persuade and that make people defensive there is a time and place for quote but your really should nt rely on them if you really need to respond to individual point you still should avoid quoting them and instead direct their attention to it with phrase like when you talk about x

NONE this first agreement seemed to have been a key part of your argument let s say me and my brother inherit a house together and we agree to get half of it each regardless why do the arab have to agree to any negotiation at all say some stranger come into your house saying that it should really be theirs because year ago he wa kicked out unjustly and now they want to kick you out instead are you going to calmly sit down with him and argue which room they will get and which one you get to keep there s a very real question in this a in other conflict about who the real aggressor is i m not saying it is definitely israel but i do nt think you can say it is definitely the other way around either the civil war which immediately followed the un resolution can be a much attributed to one side a the other is rounding up arab civilian you think are on your land and murdering them really an act of selfdefense is establishing new nation and drawing border without any input from the citizen of the territory something you just have to accept i mean imagine the un said tomorrow that the land you live in is israel a well or some other country would anyone take that lying down

AH fascism wa nt completely wiped out but germany and japan completely halted their imperialistic ambition and turned into very stable democracy is there a big difference on which country that have imperialistic ambition the pacific theater of the war definitely wa nt over when the nuclear bomb were dropped this is just something that is said to validate the nuke japan wa beat and after having the entire kwantung army evaoprate under the soviet onslaught during operation august storm it wa looking for a way out you might not have got an unconditional surrender but is not getting a few token consessions worth the life of sveral hundred thousand life claiming that the war wa nearly over in is extremely controversial give me one credible source claiming the german had a shot of winning ww after kursk your looking a bit too far down the wunderwaffe hole then after kursk it wa just a matter of time they lost all strategic initiative on the eastern front and the soviet reaching berlin wa a given dday saved large part of europe from communism not fascism the german and japanese had reaped what they had sown that like saying the innocent that went down with the tower had it coming bacause the u have been fucking up the middle east for some time
NONE a requested i will try to change your mind with a fourth option wait for japan to surrender anyway you see by the time the bomb wa dropped america had already defeated a huge part of japan s army and even pushed them back through a whole chain of island the usa wa under very little direct threat from japan the japanese were not mounting an army to attack the usa s homeland they were not carpet bombing us city they were not even massively disrupting the usa s supply line there is absolutely no way japan were ever going to defeat america ever now if you also add in the fall of nazi germany and both the usa and russia turning their sight on the pesky japanese then you ll have to concede that their chance of winning any war wa approaching zero and they knew this my counter argument to try to convince you then is this the usa dropped the bomb on japan merely to ensure that japan surrendered under their term and not those of the russian if japan had surrendered to russia or both usa and russia then japan would have ended up like vietnam or korea i also believe there wa a slight we just want to see what happens motive too this is my view anyway and i hope you at least consider it
AH you really do believe your own bullshit do nt you letmefixthatforyouyo is making legitimate point and instead of responding you change the subject trump s persona before becoming potus is irrelevant to this conversation

AH oh funny i never asked your shit opinion on what doe and doe not make a person trans but you gave me it anyway
NONE after of those thing i bet you re not even thinking about op giving you a delta even though you got him or her dtr huh
AH right so change the fucking situation how about trump say he might kill a million kid tomorrow thats not certain foreknowledge is it are you done nitpicking word that being said i agree with your last point
NONE why is this year old using so much makeup where are her parent disgrace a girl that young should nt use makeup at all and on tv it shouldnt be that visible
AH i will please do nt continue to wonder around in your fog of ignorance i understand you are probably only or but maybe start paying attention to the world about you you will be pleasantly surprised by how much you pick up after you remove your head from your as
NONE i would like to change your view in so far that you try to forget the prequels delving this much into them will only hurt the story you love and reduce your hero to mulch in the grave i m sure you have seen redlettermedia s comedic review if not give them a see
AH i ca nt repeat this enough apparently that poster specifically said other female character with consistently sexual characterization were no problem blizzard ha no plan to change those you re just misunderstanding the motivation here i understand the motivation perfectly the origin poster wa ok with sexy character showing off sexuality but not with cute spunky character showing off sexuality this is a double standard and it is wrong just because a character is primarily nonsexual doe not mean that it is wrong for that character to also have a sexy side i do nt buy that you truly believe in that kind of nuance well you are wrong i do believe in this kind of nuance if you are incapable of parsing this nuance that is your problem not mine if widowmaker s sexy pose were replaced with one of her reading proust because blizzard felt that having her only be a deadly hottie wa too simple i m skeptical that you d hail that a an expression of her right to be an intellectual because nuance if blizzard chose to show an intellectual side of widowmaker i would be ok with it if it wa part of the creative vision and not a kneejerk reaction to people complaining i just do nt believe that you really feel that way so instead of addressing merit of my argument you will just accuse me of hypocrisy nice blizzard game forum are pretty much a nonstop feverpitch cacophony of complaining all the more reason for them to put their foot down instead of pandering this will just motivate people to complain louder
NONE i hear you but that seems to be more of an argument against cultural expectation and prejudice in general it is nt a gay problem it is a human problem because of this when someone brings up something specific like this it make me wonder what their desired outcome would be do you simply think that the medium should stop only portraying gay people a flamboyant because i do nt think they do and this stereotype is going waay down just look at michael sam neil patrick harris or even the character max in the show happy ending all manly men who happen to like penis a far a the stereotype still exists for you congrats everyone is stereotyped and placed in a box to some degree also even when they do show flamboyant gay guy they are nt always annoying or unsympathetic in my opinion just look at big gay al on south park or mitch and cam on modern family flamboyant men may very well be here to stay so it is good to work towards an acceptance of this lifestyle choice all of our personality are fake and medium controlled to a certain extent but after a while they become real and it is helpful to be tolerant of a variety of personality insolong a they arent hurting anyone also it is good to recognize that even the most perceived annoying of u have emotion and are more similar to u than we might believe the more a certain type of person is humanized the better it may not help you personally but i guarantee you it helped a kid i knew who wa very feminine from the time he wa in kindergarten that case even brings about the question of how much flamboyant behavior is just contrived i want people to behave in way that make them the most comfortable much more than i want them to behave how some bigot want them to again if someone is only being an attention whore i agree with you but how do you propose we fix this problem because i d like to use the same strategy on ann coulter
AH i m just saying that matchmaticslly if you have figure that substantiate that produce them otherwise considering the mongol invasion the taiping rebellion the nazistalinistmaoist orgy of violence etc etc http enwikipediaorgwikilistofwarsbydeathtoll and that s not touching the bloodshed that preceded recorded history which people like steven pinker claim amounted to about of the death rate http socialdemocracystcenturyblogspotcomstevenpinkerondeathsbyviolenceinhtml a i recall i m going to call you out a nothing ut one more uninformed neckbeard sputtering your factfree theory into your beer
NONE from what i gather our culture have the same view on sex in general ours being even more sexualized also i wa commenting on your claim that america is like that because of not having any other intimate interaction which i do nt agree with and yes we have pretty much the same problem this http ultimosegundoigcombrbrasilspgrupousoulampadafluorescenteparaagredirjovensemsaopaulonhtml is a good example sorry for it being in portuguese it s from a local news source basically a group beat up some guy using fluorescent lightbulb because they thought they were homosexual here http myoutubecomwatch vbphpvyfkewu is a video of it happens around
AH you re seriously citing fucking mi and arguing that you do nt have to be trained in economics to understand it this is seriously a level of crazy that i m not prepared to deal with i do nt feel like dealing with more libertarian bullshit
NONE i m not here to change your view i m here to agree with you i do nt really think he s sexist racist homophobic or whatever else people are saying he is i just think he s an asshole and kind of a big idiot when it come to anything to do with politics

AH peacefully hate is a contradiction in term james madison wa a slaver that you would speak favourably of him speaks only to a weak moral fibre on your part

NONE how can i prove you wrong when you re telling me the truth
AH you ca nt treat your inconsistency a a fault on the part of the other poster that s insane
NONE i for one love it it s a type of inside joke many people are not privileged to be in on
AH well seeing a infanticide is rampant in a lot of specie it would not surprise me female animal need to secure resource for their offspring food male animal need to make sure they are nt feeding child that are nt theirs wasting resource also your argument is full of fallacy and emotional language
NONE the animal that are raised for food would never exist of it wa nt being raised for food most prey animal have no concept of their situation and often live longer than if they were in the wild being preyed on would it be helpful to talk specie by specie fish for example dont have the neuroanatomy to understand pain edit typo pretty prey
AH i would say animal torture is ok what the fuck

NONE you can buy ar s they are one of the top firearm owned in the u they are not full auto what s odd is the fact we are all still alive given the liberal idiotic belief that they will make everyone a mass murderer
AH i know because there s a huge winkly numb scar where my foreskin should be do you know why you re an unsympathetic shithead
NONE i do nt think if they fantasize there would be anything wrong with that i mean they ca nt help it it s how they are
AH you re no longer arguing about the topic at hand if you d like to return to that we can talk this is the third time i ve pointed this out to you
NONE you get to link to a hell of a i told you so i ll just link to this to point out my approval so i do nt have to write any of that
AH it is a french word retard literally mean delay or late in the medicaldiagnosis context it wa used to describe someone of slowerthannormal mental development literally meaning that a person s mental growth wa delayed that is all the meaning of the word shifted over the year when it started to be used a an insult the medical community changed their use of the word because of this to use to word properly it would really only apply to you being late for something running out the door to catch the bus because you are behind schedule you say je suis en retard meaning i am late anyone who ever used retard a a pejorative insult you re retarded came across to me a ignorant in the literal sense unknowing of term making a child s mistake of language it wa never a very good insult to begin with no one can stop you from using retarded a an insult but you will only serve to label yourself a ignorant andor uneducated
NONE your last sentence is the point of contention though even if it wa nt meant to be offensive an offensive word wa used word mean different thing to different people and just because you ve desensitized yourself to the meaning ie separated the word from their intent doe nt mean that others have i think the easiest analogy is the word fag it s horribly offensive to many gay people and it s also not offensive to some it s also been coopted by some and is used in a positive light and the majority of the internet world us it a casual profanity like you said my stance is that the use is inappropriate on the air because it conveys prejudice regardless of it intent similarly bitch and whore are bleeped out because the culturally ingrained meaning of the word are oppressive slur specific to woman fuck is an interesting one because it mean so many thing and i like the word too but i would nt decide that just because i use the word that all the kid in the country should be exposed to it against their parent wish
AH well there you go that other guy is full of shit
NONE well i guess that is just a matter of taste
AH we live in a country not american people at an organizing meeting really do nt want to hear what another straight white man think is wrong with blm not straight not white you re really not very good at this i d put money on the fact i have more oppression point than your smug obnoxious arse but i do nt give a fuck either way you may have to hang back for a bit and take some time to establish your credibility i have a inch scar where i got stabbed by a white supremacist like an actual white supremacist with swastika tattoo who run a business selling white power shit not someone who us cartoon frog meme or drank a glass of milk once doe that establish crediblity your selfrighteous backpatting ideology is the best thing that ever happened to people like pol td and stormfront and they love you for it they laugh and think up shit to encourage you fucking moron to keep being fucking moron and you keep being fucking moron i hope the smugness you feel is worth feeding those you claim to oppose i just hope your retardation doe nt have reallife consequence you people are truly truly fucking idiot and deeply destructive to actual progress on issue like race
NONE i d say it s because a conversation that devolves into fuck you no fuck you doe nt really do anything it doe nt persuade people to understanding in order to make people sympathetic to your side people have to feel like they re being heard even if you have to hear them say racist homophobic xenophobic or just dumb thing i mean if you just tell someone who tried to state their view a civilly a possible a simple fuck off and leave what are you saying to that person and others who agree with them basically that they re not worth your time and you look upon them with total disdain which is fine if that s what you mean to do but if your goal is to make the other side see where you re coming from or show them how openmindedness and positivity should be encouraged or change heart and mind about a particular group of people i d say that s a poor way of doing it think about why you re in this very subreddit you want to be heard and you want discussion without the comment section devolving into a you re stupid no youre stupid mess if you had posted this and someone just wrote fuck you asshole in response would you consider changing your view probably not
AH it is not the only possible way of course then why are you so insistent that this particular test must under any and all circumstance remain in place what first hand knowledge do you have that this particular test is if not the only way so important that it must be maintained regardless of any possible or actual negative effect and regardless of whether teacher can be adequately tested for literacy in other way but it is a perfectly valid way to test that a person ha one of the many requisite skill to perform the job the people who administer the test seem to disagree with with you can you please explain what qualifies you to make this determination about this particular test and it s place in the evaluation of teacher for nyc ca you explain in very specific detail why you are more qualified than the people who make and use the test not to mention they ve actually seen the test which you have not i do nt see a rational reason to do away with the test it would make sense that you do nt because you have not one fucking iota of knowledge to base a decision on
NONE this is where that second bit fall into place specifically being skilled enough to recognize and avoid those trap i ve shown in this sub that i m not but how is this different from i know you are wrong but not how you are wrong because if you can not marshal the evidence to refute the other side of the debate how do you know that you are in fact correct granted two people who are not truly informed on a topic can easily run into a brick wall where neither one ha the knowledge necessary to move forward in the debate but that doe nt mean the debate is pointless it ha simply identified the limit of your knowledge and understanding and exposed that neither of you can really be comfortable in your belief and position a you lack the knowledge necessary to have formed an objective opinion and no good faith is nt being willing to change their mind rather it is willing to engage in the debate honestly and follow it through no one want to change their mind many will leave conversation still unconvinced but over the course of day week or month slowly reform and change their view internally a they digest what wa said

AH but this is cmv a place to discus idea and not the right forum for your unrequested social advice first off go fuck your self second the change of view i m trying to encourage is to change the idea that negatively framed view are helpful or prodcutive

NONE you re asking for something impossible anything that ca nt be observed requires faith to believe in since we ca nt yet observe the afterlife if such a thing exists we ca nt prove or disprove it it s also possible that we re actually in the matrix right now all of u or that none of you exist or that i do nt exist or that i m a banana none of those thing are useful discussion because none of it can be proven or disproven what you have to do is decide whether you re ok with a dying and vanishing into nothing or b after you die the thought feeling and experience that made you you will go on personally i do nt think i would live very long if i believed i ll just vanish when i die i m of the opinion that there is an afterlife because it s what i have to do for survival it s a paradox that i m fully aware of and accept i do nt know if my brutal honesty will help or hurt you in your quest for peace but i do hope you hang in there there s a lot of good you can do for the other bit of grey matter in this world

AH the suicide rate for trannies is much higher than the rest of the population and it even higher for postop trannies you are trying to basically treat society a a whole instead of treating the people with the problem trannies not everyone is going to accept you in life for a number of reason shouldnt we be giving these people counseling to be strongwilled instead of trying to make the rest of society look at an obvious man and call him a woman because he got mental issue and if you do at least admit it on the same level of calling a down syndrome kid batman all the time because he belief he batman the fact that you use the term cisgendered is proof enough of your bias
NONE first off this whole thing seems like a bit of a straw man can you cite a specific university s policy so we do nt have to choose between speculating and taking your word for it he s still responsible for his action in spite of the fact that he is drunk why should nt people who become more promiscuous when drunk be held to the same standard there s a difference between responsibility and consent a person can be responsible for his or her promiscuity and still be incapable of giving informed consent if the distinction is nt clear to you think of it this way is it possible for you to hold a person responsible without having sex with them
AH i ve already said this but guess you did nt read it the house is nt perfect proportional representation but it s awfully close you re cherry picking from the small state to make your point and it s embarrassing it s fucking retarded that we re still treading this ground

AH what if you were determined to have kid someday you d want to know up front if that were off the table in a given relationship so should infertile people be required to divulge medical information on the first date you ve been asked this before and never answered why is that is there some reason for it other than the fact that bigot who use infertility a an excuse for abusing lgbt people do nt really believe that they pretend to believe about infertility they re just desperately scrambling for an excuse
NONE i could take that argument to an absurd conclusion everything you ve said could also be said about people who simply do nt want kid assuming you re childfree why would you not adopt after all is nt it a bit egoistic to not adopt while there are so many child out there in need of a loving parent the key word here is loving parent since you ca nt force yourself to love someone i do nt think anyone can be labelled a egoistic when they ca nt feel love for someone we all have different criterias to determine who we will love one of them can simply be i want the kid to be born of the union between me and that other person
AH you re an idiot edit i mean you re a pretentious asshole for thinking that simple economics can explain why a person would take their own life i m glad you have nt experienced this problem first hand but i wish that people who have no experience or knowledge in certain area would stfu a fool that recognizes his own foolishness is wise in that regard but a fool that fancy himself to be a wise man is a fool indeed
NONE what justification do you have to say that nobody of a certain gender like a certain thing that seems incredibly baseless and unfounded it would also take just one person who legitimately like said thing to render your view invalid suppose some man who legitimately had a cuckolding fetish showed up in the thread would you believe him if not why not also if not then how could your view ever possibly be changed
AH well except that guy is from the u so his view is actually in the minority well except you were only addressing me when you brought it up also i d like to point out glaring fallacy having a view held by many doe nt mean the view is false right but i do nt see how this pertains here a i already said i separated my argument against his position from my assessment of his motif being hypocritical doe nt make what i said wrong that pertains here because you ve shown your reasoning to be unsound and yourself to be unworthy of civil discussion but your hypocrisy play no part in the main argument here which you ve guided out of sight your job is to prove the assertion to be false not make accusation about the person asserting it if you do nt like that then get off of a debate subreddit and go have another donut go and get your book of logical fallacy and figure out whether it s reasonable to conclude that i m one of the fat people you hate so much again you re allowing yourself to make personal attack which you criticize others for making and again you re doing it very artlessly your hypocrisy is isolated within a single paragraph if it s my responsibility to confine my comment to a particular format then it s your responsibility to do the same you have not done so in fact you ve suggested that your hypocrisy doe nt need to be addressed i think you re probably accustomed to having conversation on subreddits where opposition to your opinion will never survive moderator review i can easily see how this could lead to the expectation of the kind of dialectical imbalance that now pervades this discussion i m not the one walking away from rationality here you already have
NONE i would say that you have actually matured and would become part of the solution to a problem you see so let u assume and i d say it is safe to do so that you do not support trump and will not support him in the future your viewpoint on him ha nt changed what ha changed is your approach you viewed the solution a making fun of him and his supporter and standing against everything he did simply because you did nt like him now you say that while you do not agree with them you can see where they are coming from that is the solution you and i hold different political view but you calling me a racist and me calling you a libtard do nt advance our cause or help to bridge any gap in understanding between the two of u it only entrenches our mutual disdain for each other trying to understand and acknowledge what those you disagree with are saying while providing thought out and reasonable counter argument is what both side of the political spectrum should be doing if we live in an echo chamber and immediately dismiss anything the other side say simply because they are a member of the other side we will never get anything accomplished having discussion is what will change view point calling each other name doe not personally i pretty much write off any criticism a person might have if they say libtard or republicunt or any other stupid name for a political affiliation in their argument getting back to your viewpoint i would say the opposite hold true you are engaging in critical thinking now and trying to understand the opposing viewpoint even if you disagree with it you are becoming the solution also do nt vote simply on party line vote for the candidate and what they stand for a an individual not based on the letter beside their name
AH i edited out no insult and there s no insult currently there i m done responding to you you re a waste of my time

NONE in some state http wwwfoxnewscompoliticsstatesatheistsbannedpublicoffice it is illegal to hold public office and be an athiest and to your second point i do nt know about the other state but here in ar you have to publicly acknowledge your belief in god to hold a liquor license at your place of business my atheist coworker flipped his shit when he went to apply for our license and found that out i would argue that both of these are oppression

AH see this is why i hate you and the internet in your explanation you could have specified what those random collection of letter stand for but no you have to be wrapped up in your own little world not being able to see past your own little thing some people are not a cool a you and do nt have time to figure out what the hell you are talking about take the damn time and say what abbreviation stand for especially when you want to open a dialogue with a deverse group of people so ill assume sjw stand for small jewish woman and i agree that throwing them around doe not help anyone but i still do nt think sjws need any extra safe place because they have lawyer on retainer well that s going to get me band oh well

AH i already stated before that english is nt my first language plus i stop intending to make an argument how could you accuse me of failing to make one xd also if you want to be a cunt i would advise you to learn more about being one since i could easily look at your history and find out how much of a loser you are life with parent low paying job post on rtinder and rthebluepill holy fuck for someone that tell advises others to grow up you should be the one growing up a roofer who life with his parent while obsessing with an online internet community literally sad
NONE another thing i forgot to mention is that by not screwing someone on the first date you get to see something important about them are they expecting it do they feel entitled to it are they pushy or butthurt when they do nt get it doe their tone and demeanor automatically change when you suggest meeting up again sometime instead of asking them to come up to your place the first three tell you a little about how the guy see the world and their own sense of humility respect for others maturity and control over their own emotion the latter tell you whether he s actually only interested in sex or is actually interested in getting to know you
AH you do nt seem to have any true concept of what hardship is people endure all kind of hardship for a variety of reason work multiple job to support a family march across the continent to protect your home support a new idea in the face of hostile criticism travel to the new world to establish a new life the list go on and on and on compared to these many people would consider it a privilege to colonize a planet seriously it boggles my mind after all the hardship people have suffered including colonizing america that you think there would not be people willing to colonize mar maybe it s time to get offline and experience some real life
NONE it s not very american to find generosity towards relative stranger unpleasant much more typically american is to find happiness in gift giving if this result in wait staff making a better living than they might with a different custom more the better i ca nt confirm this personally but i ve been told and read that in country where the american tipping custom doe nt prevail the wait staff are not a friendly and the dining experience is le enjoyable more to the center of your point for a system like ours to prevail basically everyone need to be behind it too many defector and it fall apart do nt be a defector be one of u join u jooooooooin uuuuuuus

NONE so is your view changed in regard to the potential for your so wanting a child i guess it all come down to whether you would want to be with someone who really wanted child or not or if you would be willing to compromise on that point in order to be with her
AH you are clearly a child no one else is so selfish a a little kid it s crazy you do nt give a shit about anything but yourself it s disgusting people like you are why we live in a shit society why the usa is basically a third world country because you do nt realize it take resource to pay for decent service and yes poor people do nt have those resource in your shitty dystopia you do nt care you want a wall around your house and to keep them away from you that s just truly disgusting you re an awful person
NONE that s fair to say but unfortunately for pedophile we tend to put a lot of stake into protecting our child a a society a guy who is a threat to our car or house is one thing but kid people literally would be happy to die for their kid that s just another evolved trait that is difficult to reverse so i agree with you but again can understand why they re treated so much more harshly than people with other undesirable trait again i agree they re not bad people or that i personally have any sort of vendetta here just saying i understand why it is the way it is
AH but is that because of racism or economics movie generally have a minimum amount that they cost to make at major studio yes you can use cheap actor and use only a few set but equipment costume etc are all going to be relatively fixed cost even a cheap movie like straight out of compton cost million to make and likely another million to advertise so do you make two movie like that that generally appeal to only a fraction of potential customer or do you make deadpool or iron man or there will be blood that can appeal to a much wider audience and make a lot more money you really need to be more succinct in these comment we do nt need to know that you read an article on film production cost once do you make deadpool or iron man or there will be blood that can appeal to a much wider audience and make a lot more money uh no you make none of those movie because they blow and are you trying to claim that the under representation of minority in hollywood is okay because iron man and i think that is really the problem black actor want to make movie for black audience but end up alienating other demographic yeah that s the real problem black people so the issue with under representation of minority in hollywood is because black people need to assimilate into our white culture this hamstring those movie making them le money which make studio le likely to want to use those actor or make those movie you seem to have it all figured out hey are you just out of curiosity i do this thing where i try to guess the age of the person i m talking to i ve become good at it
NONE i simply can not understand how anyone can work in advertising and not hate themselves or not just be a shitty person it honestly feel like a single step above a scam artist even if i had no choice and had to work an advertising job just to live i certainly would nt like it or myself when it come to screwing other people over and whether you can do it or not depends on how much you care about that person the quality of care change along the way from high to low and so forth and if the you draw the do nt care about people beyond this line they can be exploited by using capitalistic method a much a possible by me or others for benefit line right after the people you consider friend you will be able to exploit of the population without feeling bad about it everyone ha this line and we all put it at different distance from u based on some factor like country culture race intelligence wealth etc for most of u this line is drawn at the culture level making it possible for u to buy stuff made in cheap labor country some try not to be aware of whether the thing they are buying is made in such a place to avoid feeling bad but it doe nt mean they did nt draw the line but for some usually wealthy business owner and other suit type people this line is draw very close to them causing them to be total asshole to seemingly random people they are nt random just people who they are nt friend or more with what i wan na say is even though that person you mentioned is scum for sure you are nt exactly notscum either unless you really never buy stuff made in cheap labor country same thing done to people at different distance culture from you and just because you do nt do it to people of your own country culture doe nt make you notscum it just make you a hypocrite
AH well yeah they assume it woman men are conditioned to deal with it if it happens to them somehow the simple concept of gender bias is lost on people argueing for gender bias lmao you asked how we are shamed i explained how we are shamed if you cant grasp the concept i cant help you and i use the terminology that fits the moment your view wa challenged you instantly started screaming about raping my family your ridiculous and i truly feel bad for your son if this is actually how you act
NONE i can only speak for myself but sometimes my girlfriend understands me more than i do and she ha said the same to me it s like having twice the brain power to work my emotion out i mean we wo nt always understand it s trying to understand that matter regardless relationship are natural you will desire them and they will find you they are far from pointless even if your only criterion is having someone who understands you it s an amazing thing when you find an incredible relationship that make you better every day
AH maybe you could explain why it s not instead of being dismissive
NONE trump is evil he said we should torture even if it doe nt work
AH maybe one day when enough time ha passed by the trend will shift back the other way around and it will be people like you or me who will be loosing their job for expressing themselves who know maybe tomorrow science will discover evidence that one race is superior to the other or woman are inherently superior to men and viceversa it ok to be a racist just accept that people hate you for it and that the above will never happen dont try and be smart dont try and act like you understand science or the world around you just be a quiet little racist and let the world you grew up in die so that a better one can rise from it ash
NONE i would nt say i agree with every single point of your post but just about most of the online feminism i see is just a way for people to vent their insecurity making intensely strict rule to guarantee plenty of target to tear down we all love a good fight especially when it s just soooooo clear that the other person is the very embodiment of evil and what s more evil than transgressing against the most downtrodden right and do nt get me wrong most of the rule seem to me to be coming from at least some basis in reality and they are aimed at thing that are really not ideal but setting up kangaroo court to digitally execute each other is doing nobody any favour
AH if you think your good at guessing age perhaps you should dedicate your effort elsewhere like coming up with actual rebuttal and reading comprehension underrepresentation is nt ok because of iron man it s simply more profitable to make iron man on a hollywood budget than a movie that target black people it s a reason it s neither good nor bad your attempting to ascribe moral to an impartial decision a for how to fix it the answer is nt black need to assimilate it s arguably that black need their own production company that can make movie on smaller budget with more targeted advertising the focus should le be on making hollywood into something it is nt and instead making more indie movie and having those get noticed based on their merit you know like basically everywhere else in the world
NONE why exert more sympathy to them since they were so negligent because it cost nothing to do so because it s a tacit acknowledgment that we re all human and all have our own short coming because taking the time to sort out those people le fortunate than u into group of those we should pity and those who had it coming is a fruitless and masturbatory exercise who s only real purpose is to allow you to puff up with pride at how superior you believe yourself to be acknowledging that some one could have made better decision doe nt have to be coupled with scorn and scorn itself or more accurately the potential of being scorned is nt that great of a motivator to make better choice if your goal is to be able to sit in huaghty judgement of those around you just do it do nt try to dress it up a though it s a principled stance and do nt pretend you re accomplishing anything but pleasing yourself
AH cmv doe nt get a lot of post this wa still on the first or second page the science on this is pretty clear ignoring it doe nt make you a good person it just make you willfully ignorant which is fine if that s what you re into but try not to be such a prick about it

NONE there ha never been a revolution in a developed democracy not a single one anywhere in the world that doe nt mean there never will be one but to say that such a thing is inevitable in the complete and utter absence of evidence is foolish on it face

NONE you should take their new gender seriously and since they discovered tumblr let me introduce you to rtumblrinaction you know what an otherkin is they re like transgender people except instead of their body dysmorphic disorder making them feel like the wrong gender they feel like being human wa wrong the more boring one are like dogkin and dragonkin but every now and then there s something like a toiletkin or a ghostkin so be nice to these crazy bastard and contribute to tia because everyone like new content and you get reassurance that no you are in fact not taking crazy pill you are never going to melt those snowflake so you might a well get a sled

NONE why do you need your view changed is nt this something everyone encounter at some point in their life take it on a casebycase basis if someone s music is bothering you politely ask them to turn it down if it s your roommate talk with them assuming they re not asshole they ll compromise nobody like people who are uncourteous and there is no way to be objective about this for of case so there is no way to change your view just be reasonable about it and if people are bothering you use the incredibly useful skill of language to settle it done deal
AH trangender woman or men are in fact biologically woman no if you actually believe this you are a liar if i take a trans woman s blood and check their dna they are going to show that they are male same with the reverse to allude that a trans woman is actually a woman is an outright lie it irrelevant how they feel the biology and dna is a fact
NONE separate but equal is not equal to suggest that there is a equal alternative to the woman s only gym that is available to men is simply not possible sure there could be a similar alternative but it is nt the same and if whatever those difference are make a man want to join that woman s only gym then he is being harmed by this sexism

NONE i did nt even hear about this in the first place the real question is why are you so engrossed in celebrity news to be outraged enough about this to post it on reddit who the fuck care about taylor swift s criticism boohoo there are hundred of million of people in the world suffering and we should devote all our attention to someone because they make trashy autotuned music nbsp why doe it matter if she a hold a certain set of political belief or b share them who in the fuck would be influenced based on what taylor swift s political view is do you really believe that there are any trump supporter out there who would say wow you know what taylor swift is just such an intellectual and i think i am going to join the nevertrump movement because she is my intellectual superior if i come off a a whiny douchebag i apologize but this really pissed me off for some reason

AH you hurt my head i understand that it s a single stall bathroom with a lock that doe not change the social stigma of a man entering the woman s washroom viceversa at all how are you supposed to know it s a singlestall from the outside at a quick glance you re not i m not questioning or debating the ethic of using a singlestalled gendered bathroom i am not debating anything actually i m telling you that when someone see a guy enter a woman s bathroom chance are they might say something about it embarrassing you in a social setting without first having the time to check whether it s a single or multistall bathroom and your subconscious is aware of that or at least mine is please do nt take this a an insult but your seemingly genuine inability to comprehend simple social stigma and consequence for public act kind of lead me to believe you might have some sort of asperger s or mild autism do you
NONE you seem to be against snitching when it is motivated by a general desire to uphold ethical norm that are generally harmless when broken on a small scale for instance if i turn in a guy for cheating on a test because i think it s unfair of him to do it that s something you d be against right if so what if the same activity come from a different motivation let s say that the same guy who is cheating on the test bullied me all through high school or cut me off in traffic on the way to the test or is just a real asshole in general in this case i m not snitching to uphold any particular notion of fairness or justice i m doing it to make life just a little more painful for someone who deserves it there is an inherent risk of their reaction a you mentioned but what if i m willing to accept that risk for a taste of sweet sweet revenge
AH do you understand how the developed world work you are not a wage slave or a tax farm you become a contributing member of society feel free to leave not pay tax and live in sovereign land do nt complain when you have no shelter food drinking water or medicine

AH you seem extremely bitter i would recommend therapy andor surgery to restore function to your mutilated little weenie i am personally of the opinion that the two issue fgm and circumcision are completely different but i respect your opinion a someone who is affected by the latter
NONE you are really just agreeing with me i think in certain narrow circumstance eg professional peer of similar standing it is appropriate and useful to compare yourself to others but most of the time it is nt i feel this is different from what you said in your op
AH ah one of the i m above label crowd you guy are a dime a dozen and are nt pulling the wool over anyone s eye chance are you can be labeled easily but you do nt like the association that may come with that or maybe you simply do nt hold any conviction political or not while conviction make convict they also lead people to identify themselves with political label people who ca nt label themselves politically may be openminded but they may be absentminded too there is also the notion that if you do nt stand for something you ll fall for anything
NONE selfish here can be defined a lacking consideration for others and although i personally do nt like it when the person in front of me recline they do nt have any information on any of that some people simply do nt mind if someone reclines which would nt make the one sitting in front selfish also you should consider that you are paying the lowest fare which give you economic benefit but not leisure if you wanted to get larger space then you should consider going for business class if you have a problem either tell them or deal with it because there s nothing you can do
AH oh we put on a nice face for miserly fuck like yourself do yourself a favor and do nt go out at night since you clearly do nt know how to present yourself the lady love a cheap miserly asshole who doe nt tip

AH who what this is relevant how what in the actual fuck are you talking about can you please just go away now
NONE how about this why do you even spend this much time fussing over it who give a shit
AH rape is the only crime i m aware of where you can accuse someone and potentially even get them punished without real evidence you can accuse anyone of anything with out evidence eventually evidence will be needed to prove guilt but you can still make an initial accusation here s the wiki on rape investigation http enwikipediaorgwikirapeinvestigation and here s a page another page about the same http wwwrainnorggetinformationaftermathofsexualassaultpreservingandcollectingforensicevidence now eventually the investigation will turn into a a said vs b said but you can say exactly the same thing about assault charge trespassing harassment or any other of the thousand of crime that are primarily peer to peer in nature but because so often there s no evidence in a rape case it s become acceptable for evidenceless accusation to be taken seriously please provide a citation that rape case are abundantly prosecuted with absolutely no evidence here s a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled http wwwusatodaycomstorynewsnationnowemmasulkowitzcolumbiarapeperformanceart at that point what their doing ha nothing to do with the legal system they re just shaming the entire system until someone give into their demand that s not how it work if there s not enough evidence to accuse someone of the crime if the court turn it down then you ca nt convict them period i agree that this is stupid slightly eye rollish but one need to be cautious about drawing larger conclusion about complicated topic from the action of the stupidestmost desperate person in the room
NONE first of all sexual assault is punished severely these long prison sentence are accepted by both men and woman and i rarely see anyone contesting these punishment it seems that society a a whole share a strong contempt for rapist first it s not just about the rapist it s about the victim also note that your statement only applies for a very specific subset of rape violent stranger rape anything other than violent rape becomes far harder to prosecute mainly because people tend to have a view that favor the rapist also when people offer advice regarding way to avoid rape the rapist is still held culpable not always often the advice border on doubting whether a rape even happened look at any girl assaulted while at a college party the rape culture which seek to find what the woman did to deserve it get in the way of the conviction or condemnation of the rapist probably not i ve noticed that often when people are robbed from or are victim of other crime people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future in fact when i lost my cell phone to a thief a few year ago my entire family nagged me about how i should have kept it in a better pocket of course rape are thievery are different i completely acknowledge this however where s the line between helpful advice and rape culture i think that some feminist confuse these two placing both of them in the realm of rape culture look there is a difference between victim blaming and honest advice giving the difference is when the tone shift from how to prevent to you deserved it unfortunately the tone tends to be more on the latter camp
AH so how do we make decision based on science for example many state have law that require vaccination these law were made by politician who were elected by general public if general public remain ignorant about vaccine vaccine are science vast majority of people would then refuse vaccine because shot are painful and they would not see a benefit such people would also elect politician who would never require vaccination so end result under your syset society where million die from easily preventable disease how is that good edit removed potentially insensitive language
NONE if people andor company felt free to ignore law they did not like that would be essentially the same a not having law the law in question exist only to achieve economic outcome and breaking them is highly visible uber break them at their own risk and can be punished or fined they are nt trying to hide the fact that they are breaking the law they are doing it in plain sight and accepting whatever consequence may occur if they lose a legal battle if the potential legal consequence are nt sufficient to change uber s calculus then the problem is the legal framework not uber s behavior
AH the pleasure i get from reading a book is nt quantifiable doe that mean i do nt get pleasure from reading book it mean that we ca nt quantify or objectively prove that you get pleasure from reading book if testimony wa nt evidence why is testimony admitted a evidence in a courtroom testimony is used to supplement physical evidence case where eyewitness testimony is the only evidence available are regarded a weak case for a reason of course this ha nt kept unethical prosecutor from exploiting the ignorance and racism of jury on the matter a the innocence project ha shown many of innocent people especially black men have been executed or imprisoned for decade on such evidence if evidence with such poor track record is your standard then i ll leave you to your inferiority the ignorance is breathtaking indeed if you think testimony itself is enough to prove anything you can look forward to a bright future a a juror it s pretty well known that if you call a black person a nigger or a gay person a faggot it s very likely to make them upset i ve known plenty of black people and gay that just shrugged such insult off a the whining of intolerant bigot not worth their time that said being upset doe nt constitute harm if it did seahawks fan were harmed that their team lost the last superbowl of course by your logic they have suffered crippling and life altering emotional harm on par with being robbed at gunpoint and should probably sue would you like me to demonstrate the sky is blue while i m at it your bluster and ad hominem attack betray your inability to think about this subject rationally
NONE entitled simply mean have a claim to you have a claim to your opinion whether it is that barack obama is destroying america or that the world wa made by a giant fiery lobster in the sky that doe nt mean anybody else is required to listen to it there should be no instance that if i had that belief that i should be able to say i am entitled to my opinion to get out of a rational argument about it you re right and there is no such instance i think you re confusing angry high school student debating shit they do nt understand on the internet with everything else in the world anywhere else a person who make a factual claim and want it to be accepted because it s their opinion will be laughed out of the room your problem doe nt exist it s also important to remember that a view is nt wrong or without evidence just because you personally disagree with it you re kind of committing the very sin that annoys you here the radical religious argument against same sex marriage i am not extremely familiar with the fundamentalist marriage argument but from what i understand it come from an interpretation of the bible that s not strictly opinion that s a nuanced reading of scripture many reading of scripture exist but all are logically reasoned from set assumption that make them more theory than opinion whether you think scripture or religion are valid reason to hold a view is outside the scope of this argument the obama birth certificate scandal where wa the opinion on this one people thought he wa born in kenya turned out he wa nt people who think otherwise are misinformed which is not the same a holding an opinion reading your other example it seems that you lump everything you perceive to be logically dubious unscientific untrue or simply not to your taste under the monicker opinion could you explain what you actually mean when you say opinion
AH if your argument doe nt work without hitler it s a shitty argument you said there are obviously million of situation where voting is oppressive use some of them and use them from modern advanced country it would mean you do nt get this criticism not that i ve ever found an ancap to be bothered about having an actual discussion
NONE one of my main argument wa that child tend to see adult a mentor which is why a sexualromantic relationship is dangerous yes people in their s can be irresponsible but they do nt see their so a a mentor or someone above them so it is nt the same there is no power imbalance bullshit the rest of your post i wo nt even bother to read
AH dna decides you are being a pompous arrogant feel over realz right now
NONE holy shit this is even more racist than i thought it wa going to be
AH these are debate about prolife and abortion not about method to increase public acceptance of the prolife movement do you even read your post before you post them but your original comment did not address the op and then you backpeddled do nt blame your lack of comprehension on me arrogant and ignorant such a bad combination
NONE why do you want your view changed you reviewed both side of the argument and came to your own logical conclusion based on evidence and common sense rather than following the headline telling you to hate trump and spoonfeeding you biased political view you need to stay the way you are man
AH this just might be the dumbest thing on reddit possibly the entire internet white people
NONE til even if somebody s been a total dick all of their live i should nt downvote them on reddit
AH the point still stand that it s batshit insanity to say i a trans woman am the same thing a people who want to kill me

AH either get out or show some respect there actually is one thing he could do that s harder than those two show one federal law that is racist in intent show with stats that black are being targeted oh wait he ca nt because that shit doe nt exist he s just going to bitch and moan about the one country where he could succeed like this in football
NONE i do nt believe that those who voted trump in are racist i believe that they feel ignored by the establishment and trump wa the antithesis of the establishment he s a fucking moron and he is nt doing jack shit to help the affected area that are suffering job loss but i doubt hillary would have done any better at least trump is something different
AH you re an absolute moron mate no major left wing organization i can list off hundred ever heard of the dnc they spent million more then the rnc in the presidential election and spent million more in one election in georgia you have absolutely no idea what you re talking about
NONE if the democrat replace clinton this late in the game then they lose million of vote for clinton have already been cast you re idea would split the democratic vote and then hand the election to trump and waste the vote of million of people who have already voted for clinton
AH hahahaha you are just copying and pasting this post everywhere everyone look at this retard
NONE that s not your point at all go read your title because all you re doing is backtracking now
AH it s not the vocabulary that s just some nonsensical feelgood bullshit sentence with nothing to it i ca nt refute anything because there is no point to refute
NONE uh is there really an argument to be made against this it just seems to me like this is a obvious statement and anyone denying it wo nt have a very strong argument beyond pathos
AH love how you totally ignore the basic fact that biologically mtf is a male and always will be go cry in a corner about the truth because your obnoxious reply about what if a statistically irrelevant event happens doe nt work you have nt refuted my point you just refuse to accept it because it hurt your fee fee call me a bigot all you want and i ll call you a retard since you know zero about me besides this specific opinion
NONE wa nt zuckerberg a millionaire by then i do nt quite get the point you re trying to make a you could nt even list all of your criterion it sound like your view is ignorance or even envy of others rather than opinion people have done it and if they do it by breaking one of your criterion what s the point to be made you did nt say what of anyone who break the criterion you laid out are you calling them cheater are they just spoiled
AH this is ridiculous and you re a loser how hard did you have to look into your psyche to find a way to turn this into some patriarchal conspiracy ever thought that maybe the use of rape scene in movie demonizes rape and show it for the disgusting act it is you feminist are delusional and the pay gap doe nt exist btw you should spend more time reading into fact and le into critical theory
NONE that website is a rough simulation dyslexic people ca nt just figure it out by looking on to their past knowledge of the language and finding the pattern imagine learning to read like that your brain is nt taking the disorder and turing it into something you recognize it s taking thing that should be recognizable and scrambling them so that you really do nt even know what they look like
AH actually you did because the question wa about intelligence not success that is why you started your repy with also i have to disagree that having an advanced degree make one smart if your reply wa only about success you might a well have replied by saying i like apple because that would be equally relevant if your only point wa about success your first sentence make absolutely no sense and is completely irrelevant arguing making more money is objectively a better way to measure success is moronic by your logic the guy who invented the snuggie or the pet rock is more successful than lincoln and if you re that gifted at mathematics and physic you without question do well in finance i do nt think you understand how high frequency trading work and anyone who is that bright could easily get a harvard mba or law degree and make k starting salary and be at figure year
NONE however would nt you consider the position of someone with year of experience seriously you re moving the goalpost what you ve done here and elsewhere repeatedly is try to disagree with people by buying into exactly what your title claim to be opposing what you ve just described is someone who ha earned their opinion being strongly considered just like your phd example what people disagree with is that being older alone somehow entail that the person should be deferred to and rather we should defer to people with expertise on a topic instead regardless of age all you re doing is providing example of exactly what that position advocate respecting people with expertise on the topic ask your question again but make it a year old who s never been in a bar still think we should defer to them age doe nt give you special privilege on a topic expertise doe
AH not al all read my other comment you clearly are nt paying attention not my fault for that it s on you laddielass not me kiddo you ca nt ad hominem me ok so like i said quit while you re ahead either read think for yourself or cease and desist this is a forum for adult not child goodnight and happy reading and you might want to stop your attachment to anime etc it s infantalising your mind and not letting you grow up
NONE yes i still think you ll enjoy it much more than other place but not to the level you are fantasizing about right now you re romanticizing it it s like when you meet the womanman of your dream it s great and perfect for a year or so then you start realizing you still love them but they re not perfect if it s changed your view consider issuing a delta with enough word to make it past delta bot good luck on your house hunt
AH did you not read what i wrote this is not about me being poor ugly or attractive doe the word attractive trigger you
NONE so you d never say hang on just going to the toilet or excuse me where are the toilet would that be considered insulting
AH this is a prefect example of the southern culture way of thinking you started the conversion nice and polite and when challenge and ca nt come up with answer default to cursing and name calling i ve had not curse at you or call you a name i truly want to accept southern culture a part of the u but thank you for strengthing my belief that it southern culture that give the u a bad name and please stay down south
NONE i guess it depends on whether you want to enter a a tourist enter to work a an english teacher for a year or become a japanese citizen i imagine if you just want to visit it s quite easy but i wa just making a point that for many country their identity is ethnic simply living in the land or being born in it doe nt make you part of the ethnicity that founded the country
AH it s hilarious that you re accusing me of having poor reading comprehension when you are trying to take my word literally and totally missing the underlying meaning the point is that college can discriminate like crazy without having a formal quota or point or whatever type of discrimination method you d like to say is outlawed here s an article explaining how it s actually done based on a harvard phd candidate s research in interviewing different elite college admission department on their practice http wwwtodayscienceorgierarticle paperid and here is an important excerpt finding reveal that elite institution commonly group applicant into “ pool ” and that application are compared within but not across pool certain pool receive preference largely a a result of the perceived benefit of a particular applicant ’ s background read further you will understand that race based pooling is primarily what she s talking about
NONE but what is the endgoal then i m not sure people of these community agree about it in the same way that there s a loooot of different feminism for example all the question which both are deep and about detail are not answered by people who do not identify in one of the two gender but how is this a matter of identity a opposed to a matter of how you perform your gender it s actually funny because it s representative of a certain way of thinking of sociology compared with more mainstream one sure you can see gender a only a role that we perform but allegedly this social rule stick with in every situation and is part of your identity i think it s obviously hard for nonbinary gender to actually create from nothing totally different social practice an norm there s always inspiration from the norm the two gender appear to be two extreme and it seems that society should consider the grey area
AH the point you ve made is clear however i also do nt understand the point you are trying to make that s your ignorance that s you not understanding when you do nt understand something you re supposed to use your brain matter to try and wrap your head around it that mean stop commenting and telling everyone your unrelated point and listen stop being the problem start being the solution listen if you ca nt be respectful of others then consider leaving this sub and leaving most sub and going back to chan because we want this place to be respectful and considerate
NONE i think you have the healthy mindset i m not sure that trump supporter need to be flipped rather i think just having honestopen conversation about how we can progress down this road of living with each other with respect is the cure it need to come from a place of respect if you want someone to respect you respect them first that ll make you worthy of their respect treating someone like they re an idiot only make it worse listen to what they say respectfully disagree if you must i m rambling but all that to say it sound like you re in the right mindset just keep on keepin on
AH then you ve caused someone to commit a crime according to whom again i could just a well invoke that there is nothing wrong with bestiality and you are just closeminded it s not a crime in afghanistan this is exactly how your agument work what is sick about it is that you actually admit to doing this to unsuspecting men i d expect something like that from a thai streethooker but even they let you feel up their pussy just to make sure you are officially more deceitful that the sleaziest of thai street trans hooker i hope you are ok with not even making any money unlike the more ethical hooker above you maybe your fetish is degrading yourself or whatever but i have nt even seen a rat a despicable a you
NONE how do you expect someone to say how your friend would act towards you get new friend i m in a similar boat to op straight white male well off i m liberal and most of my friend are liberal and pretty outspoken if i say something that is counter to their belief they re still friend with me we discus if i want to or do nt if i do nt i do nt think there is something inherit in being liberal that you have to punish people for not aligning with your view if that is something that you ve found then i think you re in the wrong crowd i think you see this on reddit a lot more than in real life but you also see people that want to commit genocide a lot more on reddit than real life reddit is not real life
AH you have no argument it s dismissed get over it it s you who ca nt grasp the argument at hand we do nt enforce civil right because salty sally like yourself got your feeling hurt we enforce civil right because their is actual and verifiable harm
NONE just doing something because you re told it s the right thing to do no you give reasons for why it s the right thing to do if you teach people that their action have consequence like human pain and suffering most people wo nt do those action
AH made analogy that did not fit the analogy fit perfectly you just did nt want to respond to them because you did nt have an argument and you clearly still do nt i m going to go now feel free to use the space below throw a tantrum or whatever bye 👋 😘
NONE i appreciate you giving a second thought to these issue so please do nt think i m trying to be rude here but if it s very hard to predict then it s probably not a good idea to make outlandish claim like trump would eviscerate clinton right
AH hahahahaha you ca nt be this fucking dense
NONE so assbackwards you ca nt even see it
AH say the bigot to a man who wa raped by a woman men can rape woman can rape men can murder woman can murder men can be racist sexist predator woman can be racist sexist predator men can be bigot woman can be bigot clearly you choose to be a bigot who prejudges people simply because of the body they were born in
NONE because woman are pickier they can have more standard while men will take what they can get so men will date rail thin woman skinny woman chubby woman fat woman and obese woman woman are more likely to freeze out all but a minority of men so in that regard i agree having said that i ve met lot of fat guy in relationship
AH the fact are nt whats up for debate here you shit stain want do you want on your fucking pizza while i m here i ve noticed a small discrepancy in the content of your current post and that of your op it seem you support ubi which would be a direct contradiction to libertarian thought how is that you can hold that view and still maintain that liberstarianism is the one true political philosophy that literally everyone should follow
NONE it reward comment that do nt contribute and cause a general decline in quality it s now better to give a specific comment more upvotes just by making comment that do nt add anything a in in order to increase the visibility of an opinion i like it s better to reply i totally agree and this is so right than to just not clog up the comment with irrelevant and circle jerking
AH maybe you re treated like dogshit because of the way you act assuming being a little bit hotter would make girl start jumping into your bed left and right is a naive and frankly insulting notion and suggesting that anyone with a different opinion is bullshitting you and therefor either blatantly lying to you or so unaware of reality that they re lying to themselves is not only arrogant but also deeply insulting frankly your view come across to me a fairly childish and i doubt i m the only one that would feel that way i do nt know maybe i m wrong and you re really a pretty cool person but what i do know is that i m really not the most attractive guy in the world either honestly about a good looking a you and i sure do nt get treated like dogshit i get treated nicely when being served almost all the time i can make friend and i can date assuming the girl you re talking to want nothing more than to have sex with a more attractive guy than you might be what s holding you back here first impression are really important
NONE maybe to you but i think for many people being told you re being too sensitive feel like their issue and voice is being trivialized to give an extreme example if you were raped and when you spoke up about how you were feeling and were told you re being too sensitive i imagine you d feel very hurt and dismissed where a if you were told i m really sorry that happened to you let try to move past it together you d feel more supported and positive about the whole thing the underlying message is basically the same you ca nt do anything about the fact you were raped and can only move on with your life but the tone and message that you actually receives end up very different and since you re being too sensitive is a very simplistic and reductionist phrasing it will effectively always lose any of that important nuance thus why i say it s not a useful viewpoint whether right or wrong it doe nt help anyone understand why something is or is nt a problem that they should worry about
AH you mean to tell me that adhering to the biological imperative that created every sexually reproducing specie on the planet is a hang up edit removed insulting portion my bad
NONE nope it s a social construct edit unless you believe in judaism or another religion that is transferred to you at birth if you are part of a chosen people and your god is real then it s genetic
AH i also believe that i have defended my point adequately this is excellent evidence that sport have failed to educate or enrich your mind
NONE i think i can agree to that i still think that the ideal should be all automated but it make sense to compromise and to protect the freedom of driving
AH you re being too pc about it stop it he wa verbally attacked by a person he s never met this man is on the stage of the dnc obviously trying to discredit donald trump donald trump did nt say anything bad about his wife you re just assuming there s an underlying tone of religious hate that s your speculation and ha no form of factual evidence stop being pc about it and use your head the guy just responded to a verbal attack towards him that s a perfectly human reaction edit yes let the down voting begin because you know common sense doe nt apply to those that do
NONE could it be that trump very well might just be incompetent this could very well be the case if you take your political blinder doe he really sound like someone who know what he is doing he did nt know that firing his fbi director on a tuesday night might get negative play he did nt know about the north korean issue until the leader of china told him his people had to communicate to him via statement they said on tv because they could nt talk to him these are all factual thing he ha done doe that sound like the action of a competent person real question
AH oh right i forgot that no hiring discrimination suit ha ever born out how foolish of me oh wait that is nt the case you re full of shit but let s say they are very hard to prove and almost never come to verdict that would nt even factor in the chilling effect they would have on hr because inviting a law suit is a good way to get yourself fired and the unrecorded number of settlement so those would be two very good reason to have said law right there there s also the matter that again even if it is hard to prove discrimination in hiring practice the act itself is vile and repugnant to every principal our country stand for so why should we accommodate those who would do such a horrible thing by making it legal for them to do so
NONE i guess what i have to say to that is that revenge is one of thing that drive people to do what they do just like any of the other thing going on in our brain that determine our behavior it s no more wrong to sentence someone to the death penalty than it is for the person being sentenced to have murdered a family in cold blood both party are playing out the complex predetermined path they would have followed anyway it s all cause and effect including the law we set up that you seem to think are unfair because the criminal do nt have a choice the lawmaker do nt have a choice either they were always going to legalize the death penalty or not that s the whole point nobody get a real choice but we all feel like we do and that matter quite a bit more any of this approaching delta territory
AH i see how you conveniently convoluted my argument to fit your narritive i realise you ca nt be reasoned with now you re the type to put word in others mouth and i wont be wasting any more time replying to you
NONE please correct your grammar in this post i feel very reluctant to discus these thing with people who do nt bother to write properly even if they re wellintentioned i do nt think i am the only one
AH and most guy in porn are portrayed a being idiot who only care about sex it definitely go both way a much a it is fun to trigger you by being so daring a to suggest female are portrayed a sexual object in porn i never said male are not and i frankly dont care because this is not meant to be a moral arbitration of the standing of female v male in porn that s what sexed is for omg you solved it rest assured world now we can rest easy porn ha officially no drawback at all
NONE the focus should be more that something being sexy is nt a horrible obscene thing that society need protection from holy shit i could nt agree more i think everyone need to see and understand that the problem is nt what they think it s directly what people associate with sexuality society nowadays are associating sexuality with negativity and even the most openminded do the same mistake by saying thing like stop sexualizing woman when in reality sexualizing a woman or a man should nt be a problem in any situation a long a they are adult of course
AH calling me ignorant without any further elaboration is proving my point that i m being condescending not that you re correct about him intentionally mispronouncing the word i freely admit that i m being condescending you are worth condescending to for another explain why he must be doing it for some kind of gain yet people pronouncing ask a axe must have a speech impediment are you suggesting that aave is a speech impediment why should i believe anything from you after you have repeatedly proven yourself both rude and entirely lacking a point you re halfright to reiterate claiming i am skipping premise is not the same a making any kind of a point do you not understand what a premise is
NONE i think that oversensitive liberal are unintentionally preventing their good idea from becoming mainstream that make people say millenialssjws are pussy well not people you why do you react this way to these idea why do you care who s a pussy and who s not i do nt have any connection between whether or not someone ha a good idea and whether or not they re a pussy about the third point you ca nt prevent people from using cultural element if they re not misusing them no but you can disagree about the definition of misusing and criticize someone who s doing something you think is wrong i ask again why do you think of yourself a liberal if you are nt in favor of certain basic aspect of modern liberal thought
AH lol i m an adult arguing with a mentally retarded teenager i do nt know you but i hope you die of cancer
NONE it sound like a totally feasable plan and i m happy to know i m not the only one to have thought about this
AH got ta love reddit post a tiny note to explain a tiny detail of something that you state in the comment you see a such extreme measure and the response all but presumes that you have not considered other option are not looking at it accurately and quite possibly use this a an early resort or frequent goto everyone is sure they know how to better parent the theoretical kid of someone who posted two halfparagraphs on the internet but i ll clarify a little anyway punishing your kid hurt just about no matter the punishment just about every time when it doe nt it s because they did something freakishly hilarious and you put them in time out because it wa still naughty and try not to die laughing in front of them taking away toy hurt putting in timeout hurt holding them back from running to play hurt even in a busy parking lot because you are keeping them from the joy they want to have having to address the actual behavior hurt having your kid not want to look you in the eye to say he s sorry he hit his little sister with a hunk of firewood because he s ashamed of it hurt but not addressing it is a bigger concern but fuck you for implying i would use corporal punishment for my kid wanting a drink of water try reading a little more closely a sociopath would nt be writing about how punishing the kid really doe hurt the parent before bringing out the big judgmental gun next time
NONE you kind of have to live here to really understand but i ll try to explain the gist of it being i only have limited experience and a far a i know grownups are worse at this than teenager in my own experience people will test everyone s confidence all the time every time anyone try anything new from wearing a shit with an abnormal print on it to doing fecesrelated performanceart people will always try and make fun of you to see if you are confident in your own choice grownups are worse a far a i know my mom being a welleducated american woman really annoyed a lot of people she wa trying her best to excel at her job working overtime and studying besides her job to get better at it this did nt sit well with a lot of people it went so far that even her bos would try and prevent her from improving she since quit because of a major bullying problem at her new job she is one of the most important people in the municipality yet they still refuse her a fullemployment if you think this sound just like people being asshole it really is something slightly different even the government realizes the problem of shooting down anyone who excels at anything to the point where public school teacher are teaching kid that you should remember to congratulate people who do stuff well even going so far a to actively talk about combating the jantelaw
AH do nt really care about the crux of your viewpoint tbh i will never see castle doctrine a anything except an excuse for brutality
NONE christ man i think that s outside of the scope of cmv i ve either changed your view by now or it s not going to happen
AH are you deliberately misunderstanding this or just not that quick the terminology is different depending on where you live your definition of thick applies to your neighbourhood and school it not used that way elsewhere where i live thick mean muscled or solid a tree trunk is thick a girl described a thick ha a stumpy stocky unshaped appearance
NONE some of you redditors have a big ol stick up your as engraved on it side in big letter are the word political correctness is paramount tolerance for all i think reddit is far more antipc than pro and i would suggest that the minority who doe value tolerance over free speech is nt the group posting picture of people to mock them
AH why are you asking a leftist to give you specific or explain themselves beyond muh feeling i literally ca nt even wow just wow are you aware it is the current year is about all you will get out of them but just to add a bit of context to why they are freaking out so bad on campus it is because they are literal radical marxist and communist who s ideology literally demand perpetual revolution where they will tear down system institution at the drop of a hat despite having nothing to replace it with and stoke the flame of class conflict wherever they may be to accomplish these goal that is to say they want these conflict even when there is none also it is worth noting that much of the time a in the case of the recent spat of black church being burned that ended up being all committed by a black man they actually commit these hate crime themselves just to create tension and reason for them to protest riot and push their marxist ideology one final note the saying they keep shouting over and over at all of their protest in this missouri incident this one it is our duty to fight for our freedom it is our duty to win we must love each other and support each other we have nothing to lose but our chain is by assata shakur a literal communist terrorist in hiding on the fbi most wanted list who killed a cop these people are not rational and can not be reasoned with
NONE it s ridiculous to me because it s just a continuation of the trend of not addressing the real problem you keep removing the tool of violence when we should be addressing the cause of violence if someone want to be violent they could use nearly any blunt object a a tool can year old buy baseball bat in the uk what good is banning year old from buying a butter knife when they have a drawer full of them in their kitchen at home it just strike me a a sign of an extreme nanny state that treat their citizen like toddler the rejection of the nanny state is actually of great importance to american in particular we have deep rooted cultural belief of personal responsibility accountability and independence and it s a huuuuge problem for u when the action of an irresponsible person effect the freedom of a responsible person this can not be overstated because it s a big part of the reason that we re so stubborn about giving up our gun like you guy did a a culture we will not willingly forefoot freedom because a small fraction of u can not be trusted with them those people need to grow the fuck up and get their head right if they do nt then they can loose that freedom not everybody being a free society is not easy and people will be hurt but that s the price we pay for being free one of our nation most famous and loved founding father is commonly quoted a saying something like those who would give up liberty for safety deserve neither that s how rooted in our nation identity this ideal is
AH i clearly am not a huge fan of math but i love physic and i m minoring in env sci dude you realize that the very foundation of physic are based on math right how can you say you love physic but not math oh right because you re taking a watered down learn to color in the line and put the color block in the right place baby physic that minor like environmental science will teach you i do nt know anyone personally who studied math alone above an undergraduate level so i ca nt speak to how mathematics change at a higher level wow at least we know where your ignorance come from sorry this wa just an incredibly dumb cmv and a waste of everyone s time
NONE philosophy i do nt think kid are ready for that at that age maybe ethic and then philosophy when they re older and they need some science in there a well many job are science related and in grade five once they would be introduced to science in your scenario they would nt get anything you ca nt teach them a single thing about any chemical or biology when the child would nt know what bacteria is microbiology or the existence of it or what a chemical is maybe physic would nt be so bad because of the math but physic is nt really taught to kid until they are much older
AH you re sad you re a sad idiot
NONE i ca nt you re absolutely right
AH the tape system itself is from and wa manufactured in the s you fucking dunce
NONE he also stopped the recession from becoming a depression and saved the auto industry
AH no that s fucking stupid on so many level and is the main problem with everything being too pc i frankly give no fuck if what i dress up for for halloween offends someone they can fuck off and be offended somewhere else
NONE goddamn it the fact that this ha to even be an issue is fucking retarded you are not a bad person for not finding the majority of black people unattractive it s fucking nonsense you like what you like it s like feeling bad over liking dog over cat who the fuck care
AH i didnt say a shitty life i did say shitty job purely for experience my comment wa meant for constructive mean fuck you and high horse dickshit
NONE i once heard a feminist give a very good account for why porn can be good for woman it wa year ago so i do nt remember the point i know i m so helpful right
AH if you validate a hate group like td others join it if you vilify it even disallow it that doe nt happen that s the opposite of what happens in literally every political uprising movement were underground until they were too late it make sense now you actually have no idea what you re talking about you re one of those people who is likely low iq but think highly of himself
NONE suppose that umattmon told you that you are supposed to hate gay people and a a result you do hate gay people you are still acting maliciously you do nt get a pas on being called out for it just because i told you to act that way and actually appealing to god is an even weaker excuse in the above case you actually know that i have this opinion and you re acting on it based on that with god what god think is something that anybody can only guess at
AH guy do literally none of you know how tax work god a well a horrible people you re all also blithering idiot property tax vat council tax etcetera etcetera etcetera if only there wa some magical box you moron could put your stupid question into to find out thing like poor people pay more tax people in the poorest of household spend of their income on tax that group is almost entirely people on benefit also cigarette and alcohol will detract from your quality of life is blatantly false there s a reason they are enduringly popular because they give comfort and enjoyment to people the fact that you think some people do nt deserve to decide if they want that comfort and enjoyment is disgusting and discriminatory also it s supergross and sexist to call woman on the internet angry every time they do nt agree with your stupid opinion it s supergross to assume that the only reason people think your stupid opinion are stupid is because theyre directly affected by them unlike you some people are capable of empathy moreover if you think someone is disabled and in receipt of benefit it s disgusting to say haha do nt argue it s me about your right to be treated with dignity bc i pay your bill it is literally disgusting i am disgusted that you would say that to someone you assume is disabled i am disgusted by you
NONE just because because you do nt like the choice people make doe nt give you the right to treat them poorly which you are saying you do nt so i do nt see a problem there just that you find them disgusting that s not really an opinion a much a an emotion and everything else you said is a rationalization big nose ear chin head hand foot all will bring in the joke but do nt even think about mentioning someone s weight that s mean this ha not been my experience anybody who will make fun of somebody physical appearance will tease any part of them including weight we live in a society which support the financial burden of people who by mean of their own choice and habit have treated their body like dumpster and a a result are plagued with diabetes and heart issue what country do you live in i m in the u i only wish we had single payer anyway if this is your attitude you should also hate people who exercise injury drive accident smoke work with people who smoke or do nt eat sufficiently healthy why is our attitude currently a it is oh you re fat a fuck that s okay honey there s nothing wrong with you embrace your fold and love yourself the vast majority of people recognize that being fat is unhealthy i do nt see why it s necessary for people to hate themselves for being unhealthy
AH that analogy is moronic
NONE the whole thing is silly
AH itt op doe nt know too much about basic macroeconomics
NONE yeah i do nt know why it s so hard to grasp for op
AH people who are actually homophobic are nt the one joking around with lesbian genius
NONE i agree people in general are just too afraid of hurting eachothers feeling
AH sure and be okay with people thinking you re the worst
NONE i think you seem to forget that most people are fucking moron
AH you are an idiot if you think there is a global conspiracy of men that would prefer to keep woman tennis player down rather than make money by exploiting them to a bigger audience the truth is there is nt a bigger audience to exploit them in front of
NONE why would you want to change your view on that there s no real reason to be against it accepting it a legal is a fine view to have there s no reason to lock people up for selling themselves and if someone is forcing them to do it that s what jail is for
AH considering that japan doe nt do census by race and only nationality you made that number up or are using the nationality number which mean that a black man who ha lived there all his life is japanese lol you really think there are enough nonjapanese long term resident in japan to skew that number in any significant way furthermore you are asking for headline about racism it s been very thoroughly studied i provided link for you japan racism is extremely well documented i m not sure what you re looking for at this point i m well aware of the racism in japan i m fucking korean i ve had more than my fair share of medium outlining the shortcoming of japan you did because if you had read it you would nt have made the point you did i m still waiting for you to tell me why you are trying to compare the death of black to the nation a a whole population and not the demographic that matter why you are trying to pick apart japan when i listed a half dozen other country with similar issue and how you think that racism is exclusively and american problem because im not talking about black american we re on a comment thread about peter lin not black which is exactly why i said it s not relevant to what i m trying to talk about yes so minuscule you just linked to a site talking about what japan did in foreign war and democide what doe that have to do with racism within a country are you being serious like really serious right now i do nt know how you can say that western medium cover korean protest just a much a they do any other nation the bbc link is covering it with word and the other two are relatively international issue regardless you re picking apart my statement outside of the context of what we re talking about
NONE they have nt please explain are you saying they have nt tried you ll need to neutralise your tone a you ve gotten increasingly more disrespectful with each answer i m sorry if you feel that way i ve also felt a tone of disrespect coming from your end heck i ve felt a tone of disrespect from your original post based on the section crossed out national pride that s how you call not wanting a single group of people to have an innate advantage over the rest of the world do you not see why one would prefer to avoid that situation that s what i call refusing to promote a much easier solution to having a global language just because it happens to promote one group over another equality for equality s sake is asinine except they are much much much harder to learn and are unstable because natural language change though time and we ca nt help it we re free to stabilize english at anytime also i do nt see the problem with having language change i do nt need to be able to read chaucer furthermore there is no reason a conlang would nt suffer the same issue if it became popular secondly you did nt refute my point that natlangs have huge advantage also most of the vocabulary changed through time many latin word in romance language were borrowed during the middle age and not inherited also recognising resurrection and father wo nt help you write a book in that language just because of the morphology learning latin wa very far from being a menial task you said from scratch i m pointing out that it wa easier then your claim i would still contend it is easier then your new statement now i would also add that latin wa only chosen a an international language for religiouscultural reason that there is no reason for u to expect a conlang to have
AH because you re not intelligent enough to form one edit i didnt delete it the chicken shit mod did i dont care what a woman ha to say about my comment woman are nt a capable no amount of handicap will change that edit i m loving the passive aggressive downvoting woman arent even capable of making a counter argument woman need to stay out of life risking or life saving mission period if you cant meet the requirement set by men you have no business being relied on when it come to life
NONE i understand i m supposed to try to change your view but perhaps a counter suggestion might help what if we take your theory and instead of have selection criterion for people to prove being good enough to be parent what about an age limit say no teenage parent that might start to take care of some of the more immature related problem not all of them of course please note i am not saying all teenage parent are bad one but i m sure we can agree it s not a preference for teenager to have child
AH he ha provided the data that lead him to a position he is asking for evidence to the contrary so he can view the world through a new lens and all of these asshole start making emotional statement about how he is a fucking racist are his fact wrong yes or no not answering him and instead calling him a racist is doing nothing other than reinforcing his position it s such a typical liberal way of arguing and i ca nt stand it oh just call him a racist that will make him shut up no fuck you that make you look like an asshole
NONE if you do nt know for sure ask i used to be a quality manager for an aersopace manufacturer and i had to explain numerous time that pretty sure is nt fucking good enough your default answer to everything on fucking earth should be i do nt know until you know him asking for information to form an educated opinion doe nt scare me one bit it s to his credit donald saying he know more than everyone while being so full of shit make him nothing more than a mountebank he s lb of shit in a lb bucket hillary is smarter and doe her homework but she is just the fucking devil in the flesh
AH this is the pedantic and selfrighteousness i am referring to right now people under are nt free to vote either or some felon i did nt say it wa based on freedom initially and for all time for everyone it wa a concept rooted in freedom though it did nt just like now extend to absolutely everyone obviously there were flaw in the first stab at thing under the constitution but the bill of right wa in there lincoln freed the slave but did not give woman the right to vote is he no longer to be regarded a the great emancipator only if you are going to be pedantic and selfrighteous in addition to missing the point washington is revered for his helping found and hold together a new country that wa admittedly not absolutely perfect in every way he did not morph into a totalitarian dictator insisting in all way it must be even though it would have been done against the will of the people so i guess there is that flaw he ha mlk is revered for his oration on racial harmony and his effort to that end his speech did nt include any mention of feminism or gay right and they did nt help immediately achieve equality for all everywhere so we ca nt look up to that guy either i suppose so
NONE i sympathize with your view quite a bit almost everyone even just a hundred year ago held view that are hopelessly morally backward by today standard and knowing that for example woodrow wilson wa horribly racist make it more difficult to appreciate any of his positive accomplishment the key here though is that almost everyone wa that way we did nt come up with our moral today out of nowhere we learned them from people around u the question is nt am i a better person than someone from the s but would i have been any better if i d grown up then judging them for being morally backwards because they were racist sexist and so on is a little bit like judging them for being technologically backwards because they had nt invented the internet yet that is nt to say we can or should ignore the actual evil of the time and frankly some of the people in the past held view that were backwards or abhorrent even for their time and society and perhaps we might judge them for that but on the whole it s not particularly fair to judge a historical figure for what would be a moral failing in a modern person if we were to judge them at all it would be for the position and belief they took on what were the leading moral debate of their time someone from the s probably should nt be judged for racism when everything in society told them they should be racist but it would be fair to ask where they stood on slavery
AH your brother is still a human being that experience life and enjoys it in his own way it is selfish for you to want to kill him because he wo nt advance society you need to take a step back and unfuck yourself you selfish sociopathic shit
NONE this is communism at it finest this man literally want to take money from the rich who worked their whole life for their fortune and give it to people who do nt work is this what capitalism ha become a complete an utter joke i refuse to accept that
AH that s not how any of this work and if you re going to say you re not a part of a monolith of idiots… why are you writing what can only be described a pao fanfiction
NONE i think that may be it conscripting military service for two year is a very specific ask and not quite what you are after that may be the source of much of the confusion here
AH you and i both know that if someone genuinely doe nt see themselves a part of the culture they were born in they would not identify with it you can be part of a culture without identifying with it though it would be wholly innacurate to consider that person part of that culture i do nt care if you disagree because feminism is an ideology not a culture and it wa really stupid of you to compare it to christianity and culture someone absolutely is nt part of an ideology that they do nt identify with agreed you re the one that brought it though absolutely but this whole religious discussion started with you connecting thing to christianity but i digress are you even being serious right now are you really that dumb that wa me responding to your point about christianity youre the one that first mentioned christianity
NONE i would still think that with any action that i have ever taken i could find selfinterest to be the backbone motivation but now you are extending this to every other person who ever existed you do nt know the motivation for all of their action you and people around you love chocolate doe it make sense to conclude that everyone in the world who ever existed love chocolate too it ha never been proven not to be that case a a result the view can still be held but it never been proven either way you are just stating an opinion based on your own personal feeling and no proof if i can not accurately make a conclusion based off this i will examine the only case in which i can why who is forcing you to do so why not just say i do nt know if other people are motivated by selfinterest
AH determine the morality or value of the entire country and forcing your morality and value on the entire country are equivalent to everyone who is nt larping a an english teacher and the guy s in india so you re just being an as so yes you re arguing against a straw man
NONE there s nothing wrong with having an opinion on the culture or way of life of other people but it s easy to be an asshole about it and being an asshole is nt so great you also have to remain critical of the category you are using when you think white trash thug and remember they are a bit reductive and simplistic
AH theory are nothing more than rational assumptions the big bang theory is unproven just like creationism is a theory you re a idiot to try to claim them a fact it s so easy to tear you apart it s like you re not even trying you re purely a simpleton that s the easiest way to put it so your little intelligence can understand it
NONE then it s pretty much impossible to change your view you recognise that your view ha a lack of evidence to support it how are we supposed to change it then i think it s an impossible task it s like me saying unicorn exist cmw yes i know that there is no evidence for but i think they are real how would you even begin to cmw in that case
AH i know this get said a lot especially on the internet but that wa the stupidest thing i ve ever read
NONE he wa one of the first to publish it but i do nt think he coined it though ha this changed your view at all
AH you are being so fucking white about this issue everything you said is a bunch of hetero nonsense i ca nt believe a person could be so male do you see how insulting and frankly moronic this kind of language is why not just use better word let me put it this way you want u to use context to know you are nt being a bigoted dick but in the context of your family member you know they are personally bothered by your use of these word yet you continue to use them in front of that person in that context how can we read your language a anything but insensitive selfish and assholish

NONE generally speaking i agree anyone who tell me check your privilege a a counterargument is liable to get themself checked in front of a moving bus however there are instance where your opinion is clouded by privilege for example i did nt have to pay for my college education this might lead me to think that it is nt that difficult to get through college and people who fail or drop out are lazydumb the problem is that i m assuming everyone ha had the same advantage a me maybe they were working fulltime on top of school and so it wa much more difficult for them than it wa for me used properly privilege should nt mean you have it better than me so your opinion is invalid it should mean you have had a relatively easy life and you might be underestimating the struggle that others face have you considered these other factor

NONE so what s the difference between tagging something a nsfl and saying contains imagesdiscussions of gorerapeetc sanctimony and tone policing nsfl tag and request are presented in a more friendly manner you re coming to me on my level with no hostility even if you say oh my god tag that shit nsfl because it ha the tone of someone who just accidentally poured salt in their coffee trigger warning come with the tone of you being the ambassador for being offended by this you mention social justice baggage but that seems to be all in a name well it s like john wayne gacy giving you parenting advice nobody like sjws a they are offended by everything and generally seem to value the validation they get through feeling superior than actual concern for others it s not exactly known a the charlie chaplain mustache because it wa tainted by someone everyone hate maybe but the poster still is urged to give the alert in the first place only in some place they go fullbore on rgameofthrones but honestly if you are nt caught up and you re on rgameofthrones you have nobody to blame but yourself i do nt quite follow what you mean by this comment could you elaborate with spoiler there s a halflife i do nt have to spoiler alert the sixth sense ending vader being luke s father or tyler durden being a figment of jack s psychosis if i make a reference to fight club and you give me shit about spoiling the movie no you re wrong for not having seen a movie that s old enough to vote with trigger warning nope you re wrong and you have to stop because of my feeling and how dare you i have authority over you based on my feeling that s not okay

NONE outrage over a planned tv show any one of them is unreasonable you do nt have to watch it people are free to make whatever art they want just because you may find a story ugly doe nt mean it shouldnt be told or there is no beauty in it if you feel a piece of art is upsetting there is a good chance that it is directly challenging you to think about assumption you hold and evaluate if they are true this is part of growing

NONE most importantly semantics is concerned with what is meant by our language so saying that we re just arguing semantics is akin to saying we re just arguing about meaning which is exactly why the discussion is happening to begin with i do nt understand this if i m arguing with you about whether or not we should let s say dig a hole in my backyard what ha the meaning of the word involved got to do with whether or not the hole should be dug what kind of argument are you talking about generally we assume that the person we re talking to understands word in the way we intend them to if i use a word and what you take from it is different from what i intended you to then that should be clarified and moved on arguing about what a word mean is pointless you just need to a you say establish a shared understanding the easiest way to establish a shared understanding is to say okay then what do you mean by sqazzle and just accepting the other person s definition for the sake of the argument if you ask them what they mean by squazzle and you say no that s not what it mean at all then you ve changed what s being argued about this might be when a person legitimately say now you re just arguing semantics let me try an example here let s imagine for a moment that i insisted to you that i owned a yeti you say there s no such thing a a yeti i show you my yeti and it s a german shepherd you say that s not a yeti that s a dog at this point the argument is no longer about whether or not i own a yeti the argument is now about whether or not my german shepherd is a yeti we both agree that i own this creature what we disagree on is what yeti mean now it is a completely different argument i might then dismiss the argument because i wa just trying to convince you that i had this animal and i do nt really care about what you call it
AH your attitude just show that you re a freshman or some shit and you think you re wicked cool for drinking you seem really adolescent considering you do nt understand alcohol lack of experience the shit ai nt fun if you re trying to get shitfaced if you got food in your stomach and you continue eating while drinking then you ll get way more drunk before passing the fuck out and you wo nt end up with your stomach fucked halfway through the night just eat bro how do you not drink a couple beer and not wan na go eat something immediately
NONE i used to be like you thinking that drinking made people into complete asshole and wondering how it could ever be fun then i actually got drunk for the first time with people i actually like and had an amazing time with ton of laugh drinking is nt something i need to have fun but if i m going to a house party i will probably get drunk because it s fun to be drunk with my drunk friend maybe you re like me and just need to experience the sensation of drinking with friend to understand why people do it so often
AH when i wa looking at scholarship i wa ineligible for half of them because i am a straight white guy guess how i know you re full of shit http wwwfinaidorgscholarshipsracescholarshipspdf le than of all scholarship program and le than of the total number of individual scholarship consider the student s race among their eligibility criterion most racerestricted scholarship also include additional criterion based on academic performance extracurricular activity and community service
NONE it also depends what level of academia you re engaged with i m in graduate school at fairly prestigious institution for biology research and the resource available to me are vastly greater than the resource available to someone at a small no name low tier school the sort of professor recruited by school is also entirely linked to the name of the school the brightest best student may not have many opportunity if they re learning from mediocre teacher which to be fair is of course not to say that the best teacher are only found at prestigious school
AH then why post to begin with that s how this sub work you make a post wanting your view changed if your view is changed you reward people accordingly it seems like it doe nt take girl scout level of planning to figure out that if you re going to put yourself to task that you should bother learning how to complete the task in the first place because when you made your post it wa a promise to the people who reply that you will give your time and attention accordingly and reward those who impact you so why would you post without knowing what to do that s like buying a car when you ve never been behind the wheel did you expect to learn it on the fly i m asking why you bother to post to begin with because i legit want to know i want to know where this sense of entitlement that you re allowed to waste people s time that you re allowed to deceive people and be so cruel how do you justify this are you not aware the consequence of your action why not
NONE but the same logic applies to people who do nt want to see it anymore i do nt think it doe when you click rall you expect to see all sub reddits when you sub to something you expect to see it on rfront being banned doe nt mean it disappears there are no false expectation and unknown action taken on your account people who are annoyed that it s still there and possibly google how to get rid of it or just deal with it that s sub optimal and assumes user competence which again a developer should never do if people need to go to a third party site to figure out what happened to their account that s not good they may not even know they re suppose to google anything under the current system everything is clearyou click on rall and you see everything when you do nt want to see something you tell reddit what your suggesting is reddit taking action unknown to you subverting expectation requiring you to have preexisting knowledge of the website and take control away from the user
AH there is no hope fuck you all you want to do is twist the knife in my soul and you are too fucking stupid to even realize what you re doing you want nothing but to prolong my suffering to soothe your own personal feeling my desire are irrelevant to you the only thing important to you is that you continue to believe that guess and check is a legitimate mean of medical treatment because you did nt have to take dozen of useless medication that all made everything worse every single time have you been an inpatient have you been an outpatient have you been in group therapy what about electroshock therapy have you taken ssri how about snri s maoi other class of antidepressants have you tried antipsychotics have you sat while harvard educated doctor have absolutely nothing to say in response when you ask them about the efficacy rate of the treatment they are prescribing have you had a doctor remain silent when you ask them what the ten of thousand of dollar wa supposed to accomplish other then make your dick limp and your asshole bleed i m not even kidding i took an antidepressant and all it did wa made me impotent and give me hemorrhoid wa that supposed to work by giving me a reason to be depressed thus making it simple sadness i ve tried them all many multiple of each nothing help do you think i ll get better treatment if i hop the white house fence to ask the president i doubt it believe it or not i once had access to some of the best mind in the industry they were fucking clueless so come on shit for brain tell me what way i have nt suffered yet so i can suffer for you in those way so i can convince you of what i already know the cure is for me to leave this mortal coil
NONE i do nt believe it is i believe you can find a breakdown online but you are not upper middle class you are not even simply upper class you are the top the yes i realize there are billionaire who dwarf your wealth but imagine what that gulf in wealth look like between someone like you and someone like me who at one point wa part of a family without enough money to pay for food despite the fact that all of u except the youngest who wa only a child worked multiple job sometimes in excess of hour a week we re better now but we still live such that engine trouble tomorrow can still be considered an emergency i do nt hate you nor do i hate the few people truly do you havent done anything wrong but again consider the difference between me and and you and you and the billionaire i have starved man have you doe your life suck when compared to the billionaire or are you both very fortunate to lead the life you do when thing were especially bad my mom had to deny a homeless person their request for a couple of dollar she broke down cry and explained that she could nt even spare a couple dollar to buy food for her own kid think about just how much you can spare without seriously impacting your quality of life while many of u struggle to get by that s where the resentment come from because you could do it but choose not to please dont view that last sentence a an attack i do believe it s your money and you can do with it a you wish but understand that with the resource you have available people will judge you on how you spend that money again im not saying that keeping your money make you a bad person i think you sound like a good person im just trying to explain why some people dislike the rich without knowing anything about them
AH i m sorry i did nt realise you were the arbiter of other people s gender i bow to you edgyness
NONE i completely agree with this opinion tbh i do nt see anyone being about to change how i see it
AH well look at it this way fuckhead do you think it would be right to erect a monument to goebbels in berlin today i mean it would essentially be a monument to antisemitism but hey we ca nt judge the moral of a hundred year ago right time were different and really it s just honoring the honored men in berlin that died during the war right use some sense you wetbrained cunt
NONE hey you re right columbus wa a cruel man who started a movement that made a whole people almost go extinct sure he wa the start on what u citizen consider to be the best country in the world but that s not any reason to celebrate do we celebrate hitler stalin or genghis khan no because they were cruel massmurders the same should go for colombus
AH are you fuckin serious
NONE lol are you serious goddamn man
AH buddhism taoism shintoism hinduism wiccan that s just off the top of my head really you have absolutely no basis for saying this whatsoever you basically just went well christianity wa violent and now it is nt islam formed year after christianity therefore it will take time to mellow out like christianity logic that is such astounding bullshit it amazes me for one thing it completely ignores religion that are recent and do nt have a huge history of violence like mormonism new age philosophy jehovah s witness etc it also ignores every single other religion like the one i listed above which do nt follow this path in other word virtually every religion except christianity and islam do not follow this narrative you pulled out of your as you literally judged an entire complex movement of individual based on a sample size of and that s beside the fact that christianity did nt just fucking mellow out after year where the fuck are you getting this from the protestant reformation do nt real you re either under the age of or you re an idiot or both history doe nt follow some narrative where a bunch of people decide to start a religion and just go on some milleniumlong rampage until they collectively decide to settle down you literally just pulled this out of your as and made it up i m very tempted to post this to rbadhistory
NONE just because they have nt been acting like such dick since then is irrelevant we are in an up period for christianity and a really down one for islam worldwide actually i think it s very relevant even if op is nt aware of the past of christianity we re not seeing an up time for christianity we re seeing a secularization of it it s been turned more into a personal belief system than a political movement islam is still a much of a political movement a christianity wa in the dark age which is why it is so violent a a result what the muslim world need is secularization to temper their problem all religion can be spun to endorse all kind of shitty thing it s really more dependent on economic condition education and quality of life of the religion follower at the point in time not the religion itself i disagree with this ignoring islam for the moment which i think we can all agree have call to violence let s look at christianity deuteronomy specifically say to kill your kid if they disobey you eat too much are drunk etc a true christian should follow this rule set down by their holy scripture why do nt they it s simple there is another source that ha a higher influence on their moral than that of their religion many muslim have reached this point a well but not enough to truly put extremism on the outskirt of their culture
AH sorry did i say anything in my post about privilege did i in fact use the word privilege smarm is such an easy way out please try again or do nt bother

NONE again you mentioned living in fear in your post if you could ensure the use of fear wa nt used would you mind bringing up kid religiously for example if i raised my kid buddhist which ha at the core a instruction not to take anyone s word for anything i ca nt see what you could complain about
AH what a pretentious way to let someone know of a spelling error like he doe nt know the word zeitgeist

AH you people i am restraining from calling you all kind of shit right now god you re so fucking immature not only do you generalize and continue to generalize but you respond rudely to thing that were either polite or neutral i do nt understand why you ca nt stay civil do you just have this inane distaste for the all lefty a for your question no i did not know that but now i do it not like i go everywhere on reddit and i know all this i m decently new and i only go to two subreddits
NONE so you re not arguing that other people like the american you speak of are wrong in saying they sound more pleasant since that s completely subjective they re just not pleasant to you and you do nt think you re alone in that opinion is that right if so what could possibly change your view it seems like i d have to convince you that you re wrong about what you find pleasant which i do nt think is possible any more than it possible to convince someone who hate banana that they re wrong about that and they actually find them delicious
AH you obviously do nt read ca nt read or choose not to read there have been at least article written on clinton accepting campaign donation donation to the clinton foundation from middle east regime including link above this is nt a secret so do nt play dumb no one buy it if donald trump had accepted million of dollar from putin for his foundation campaign prior to becoming president what defcom level would cnn msnbc be at regarding trump colluding with russia yet that is exactly what clinton did
NONE i m not sure being a leader is directly related to raising the big buck remember that paul ryan got some national recognition a a vp pick in which should also be considered but usingopensecretsorg in here ’ s her being the leader in fundraising http wwwwashingtonexaminercomnancypelositopsallothersinfundraisingmillionfordemocratsarticle that ’ s more than any other democrat and speaker boehner only got so she crushed him and he had the leadership position can you name one person who can out raise her
AH literally you keep using that word i do not think it mean what you think it mean is it a joke hyperbole only talking about the extremist only talking about global warming it s all of it they are not mutually exclusive that is a logical fallacy to assume such a thing it s not excuse it is what is happening it is a joke to him both the current belief of climate change and it fanaticism a well a how those people handle it he also speaks in a hyperbolic manner in many way it is parroting what the opposition doe in reverse obviously for publicity a well a effect only talking about the extremist what global warming and climate change are literally the same thing global warming and climate change are literally not the same thing even according to those scientist in the pocket or not they represent entirely different idea and are almost contradictory to each other in inclination climate change is merely a broader spectrum term to explain the potential of global warming climate change a an ideal sometimes supposedly explains why some place are colder a a result of both natural and manmade climate change because obviously the entire globe can not warm if place get colder you can not have global warming be a thing while climate change explains why thing also get colder hence why it is contradictory again why it difficult to take it seriously when they can not seem to get their own stuff straight they are related but not the same one may include the other but it doe not mean they are the same global warming may be a causephenomena of climate change but it is nt in itself climate change literally your assumed community dropped one a it wa outdated for another they are not the same you re just throwing out anything without bothering to have an open mind or even read why are you even participating in a such a subreddit
NONE what about the pacific ocean radiation that went viral on social medium about a year ago or the world ending in i think man made global warming is believable enough and scary enough to be a sensationalized idea i think you re generalizing about people not accepting truth that negatively affect them people will believe anything if they re told it over and over again or if enough people believe it already or maybe people accept global warming because they re concerned about the wellbeing of the planet and are taking a better safe than sorry approach touche on that you re right human certainly can believe some silly thing especially when crowd mentality kick in vaccinationautism hysteria come to mind i think where the distinction is made for climate change is the overwhelming scientific consensus i know it s annoying to keep hearing that over and over science is hard to understand and many people are not scientifically literate enough to be shown graphsdatatrendsclimate model and make unbiased conclusion based off of them especially in the span of a minute news report i think that s why scientist have resorted by and large to saying we re expert just believe u it s not baloney though a little understanding of science an open mind and a google search will reveal the evidence they draw their conclusion on and it is very compelling in the end you re right that it is nt black and white it s not a case of we re gon na be totally fine and can keep doing what we re doing vs the world is heading towards an apocalypse that will wipe u all out the undeniable part is that we are rapidly changing the earth driving a mass extinction and that we will start to see these change impacting u more and more it is up for debate how severely these change will affect u and in what way exactly
AH you are still wrong when you say i do nt care to be convincing in a cmv thread you are just wrong and still is unaddressed hey bud when you use quote you should actually quote someone s word and not make shit up misrepresenting what someone say and arguing against that is called a strawman argument that s your problem you ca nt seem to read simple english and substitute what you think other people have said for what s actually been said

AH yeah except for the fact that if you knew how to read the graph we are both looking at the fact that the observed reading the blue area are above approaching on the temperature anomaly axis show that the temperate is increasing over time the temperature is anomalously high for the last decade going further if you had actually read your own source you would have noticed that the total column water vapor show a clear increase with a trend line and everything of the atmosphere s ability to retain water vapor which is positively correlated with an increase in mean temperature literally every piece of pristine data that you cited show an increase in temperature over the last decade you just need to accept the fact that you are wrong about this and move on you screwed up and cited a source that doe nt support your claim it s ok there are other thread to go troll and eventually your googlefu will be good enough to find the data you are looking for
NONE i m just looking for upper and lower bound here we ca nt retain more than we produce i m a bit confused about what you are saying here we are not producing energy that is affecting the climate the problem is that we are producing gas co and ch which make earth absorb more energy from the sun see page of this http wwwsandiagovjytsaosolar faqspdf for the a rough estimate of the total amount of energy striking the earth s surface from the sun from that you can see the amount of energy human produce is pitiful the way we have an impact on global temperature is by making earth keep more of that total sunlight a for the amount of energy it take to increase the surface temperature of earth by deg i m really not sure this is the kind of thing you would have to read paper to extract but it is kind of unimportant for our purpose if you want to make prediction then it is important the primary problem is that by making earth better at holding onto the sun s energy we have offset the equilibrium in the direction of heating by a significant amount earth will continue to increase in temperature until it reach the new equilibrium even if that new equilibrium is only slightly higher than the temp is now it will have a lot of damaging effect i would also like to say that my example in the last comment is wildly inaccurate and just there to make a point earth should emit roughly the same amount a it absorbs otherwise we would see the temperature change very quickly the ratio of emitabsorb should be very close to but not exactly at a there are other source and our avg temp is changing just very slowly on human scale fast on geologic scale
AH hitler wa a socialist no actually he wa nt that is the most ignorant and disgusting comment i have ever heard the nsdap pretended to be socialist because it wa popular and they wanted to get elected once in power they showed their true right wing fascist color i d love to hear your theory on the holocaust too i want you to be seen for the bottom dwelling scum you are down voted for promotion of holocaust denialism
NONE i agree with you monument show respect if societal view change then we need to understand that and try to see what keeping a statue up represents i heard from a german citizen that he respect this certain nazi general in the army from the s but he would never want to have a statue put up because there is so much wrong with nazism that it would look really bad to have a society like germany honor that

NONE for many people the best way to ruin their passion is to make it their job because you re doing it for external reason instead of intrinsic instead of it being something that you do when you want to do it on your own time it becomes something that you re forced to do even when you do nt want to do it much better to find a decentpaying job that you re good at and do nt mind and pursue your passion in your free time

NONE woman were granted the right to vote through peaceful protest it s honestly the only example i can think of but it worked they made the power that be realize whoever wa the force behind granting them the right to vote would by and large get their vote for the forceable future which the republican did holding both house and the white house until hoover and the great depression finally losing the house in and the white house in edit in other word peaceful protest only work when you have something to sell you ca nt a protestors who identify a democrat go out to republican saying give me what i want or else i ll vote democrat you we re going to do that anyway now when a large part of your constituency wa out protesting you that s when thing happen if you got republican out protesting republican action saying we re gon na bounce and vote democrat unless you do what we want that s when protest work or if these democrat were actually coming out on single issue saying hey you let u keep abortion and we ll vote republican for the next year you better believe abortion is nt going anywhere

AH you re comapring apple to orange here a botched operation is nt a choice so a willingly abstinent individual and someone who ha been mutilated are in two completely different ball park comparing actively choosing the murder of a child to an auto accident is ignorant aside from these example so far all i have gleaned from your argument is that abortion is ok a long a you are irresponsible and too poor to raise a kid but horny anyways it s perfectly cool to kill child cause whatever you seem like the type of person that will continually respond just to get the last word so have it cause this conversation ha not only revealed your ignorance but strengthened every steriotype i have ever heard of pro choice people have a beautiful day
NONE then it is my honor to be your first “ my life wa way better with cigarette in it ” i quit smoking cigarette year ago and i have every intention of starting again later in life smoking can be wonderful and i really miss it furthermore there is quite the bias if only count people who quit smoking we can also outlaw burger because while they are more enjoyable they are le healthy for you than a salad after all thousand of doctor and scientist all say that vegetable are more healthy than a big mac they are only referring to what is the most healthy option not what is the most fulfilling option if health is the only thing that matter then that sound like a bleak world i find it very patronizing that you seem to think that every smoker is in such a state of denial that it requires state intervention to “ save ” them
AH you say that it s a science and people are working to make it unbiased that it is therefore unbiased a if these people automatically make it unbiased it is either appeal to authority or flat out wrong no it s confidence in a system designed to weed out bias how is it controlled for you get mad at me for making unsupported claim but here you are making an unsuported claim weighting time of day how in the ever loving fuck can bias be time of day based the fact that people who lost are more willing to talk to poll than people who won unsupported and idiotic i could just a easily claim the opposite the type of people willing to answer a phone from a random person in the first place doe this have any political bias no then do nt bring it up that there is a liberal bias in the poll that doesnt hold up because jesus can you even walk and breath at the same time if you think these are invalid just because they deal with the election then you need to prove that the opinion poll held are somehow better than these and why they would nt just have used this super not biased method during the election a well dude i m just done you re either trolling or an idiot and in either case i m blocking comment reply i ve explained it again and again and i doubt i m the first to do so if you really ca nt see a difference between an opinion poll and a voting poll then you are truly a complete idiot have a nice day try not to drown when it rain
NONE i do nt want to be wordpicky but i am not theorizing the title of your cmv is that wa an inside job i just have doubt with the official story and that s natural have you ever heard the phrase stranger than fiction in reality thing do nt line up and they are messy but all you have here are govt failed to do it job this one is not a shocker when we see the govt flub up on thing all the time hell just look at the bay of pig invasion which wa messed up because the military did nt account for the time change govt ha done shady stuff in the past for starter the majority of the thing you listed the govt did nt do but merely thought about doing also the gulf of tonkin hardly qualifies a a legit false flag operation some people disagree with the current story this is an appeal to authority and a bad one at that some people benefit from the tragedy a they will with most place none of this is compelling enough to posit a conspiracy in other cmv people do not always have hard fact to back up their belief so i do nt see why this would apply here and those people are usually criticized for not having belief that can be rationally supported bottom line here is you are asking people to disprove a conspiracy something that a i ve already said is essentially impossible this is even more of the case when you wo nt do u the favor of actually giving u a concrete conspiracy to attack
AH my point is that ethic do nt come into play for u any more than it doe for any other carnivorousomnivorous animal we are what we are what why do you bother trying to argue when you know that you dont know what you re talking about human are what s called moral agent it mean we understand the concept of right and wrong and we re able to try and choose to do the right thing or the wrong thing lion are not moral agent because they re not intelligent enough and so thats why we dont think it immoral for them to kill gazelle please dont waste people time pretending to know what you re talking about
NONE yes of course i have reason why i do nt want people doing various thing but that s not what we re talking about you re not just saying you want them to stop doing stuff you re saying it should be illegal i m trying to show you that we do many many thing to animal that you ve already said in other comment should not be illegal but that are far more harmful to the animal than sex is likely to be and that have a few or fewer benefit so it s inconsistent for you to want to make sex with them illegal given all those other perfectly legal way we use animal so the only reason i can see why you might still hold the view is that you think it s disgusting and do i really need to spend any time explaining why we should nt make law about everything people find gross
AH damn right now im a bear so fuck you im a bear
NONE i dont believe in friend or love god is a joke
AH explaining the world to a child is not programming and to compare all child to an autistic child or thinking of child a equivalent to having a mental impairment make me fear for your kid

NONE it doe nt have to be about survival it could just be the quickest method that take the least amount of effort to fit in and that could totally be due to cowardice think the phrase you miss all the shot you do nt take but i m willing to bet that there are some people particulalry some teenager who genuinely derive happiness through the friendship gained by cynicism i do nt think it s necessarily healthy but i do nt think it need to be unhealthy either
AH the fact that you consider rule to be the determinant of decency indicates that you are a despicable human being i just wanted to inform you of that
NONE how would that have any effect whatsoever if the bias is unconscious the only way to reveal that is to review their decision and see if there is a discrepancy
AH for a troll you managed to keep it going for quite a good while
NONE til that some people want to make a lot more money but not really work for it
AH nicely said op is a whiny racist asshole

AH were it not for the seemingly normal post history i d assume you were a troll at this point it is possible to have a discussion about an issue without immediately redirecting to a different topic hillary clinton s action themselves are not what i m talking about
NONE but how would that possibility have been any le likely if she received all official work email on a department server there is one boom p sorry amazing mod i know i am probably violating the rule can you assume that i used humor to support ntertainme s opinion
AH you should give argument instead of just commenting on my personal character i can do both just fine thanks sans the father being culpable for his progeny see you did know the answer after all
NONE i do nt think anyone can argue against the argument you have laid out good job sir i would love to see your argument more so on sexual consent there is a cmv on the topic right now a well
AH the fact that you provide a rational counterargument to something doe nt make that something a huge leap to conclusion also not sure why you keep trying to direct an otherwise interesting conversation with aggressive arrogant tone refusing and screaming jesus what an overstatement you re being a twat for no reason in fact it s completely counterproductive when you re actually making valid argument chill with the ego shit and most people go from this guy a twat to this guy make sense
NONE so your evidence that human almost always do anything is a singular incident with att should nt that turn into att at least once ha tried to make a quick scammy buck secondly do you think you re unique are you trying to make a quick scammy buck beyond that let s take a look at all the social worker the people volunteering the massive percentage of people that contribute to charity if they are indeed always trying to make a quick scammy buck the certainly are shite at doing so
AH of course you can i overcame severe panic attack and gad by meditating i dont think you have a clue what you re talking about but then again im on reddit of course you dont antidepressants are a glorified placebo look it up they re effective same a placebo edit published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug company reveals that most if not all of the benefit are due to the placebo effect http wwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc cop that you fucking dweeb
NONE well there ha to be some reason that nearly everyone in power is male right it s not just a coincidence obviously if you make the additional assumption that society is systematically biased towards men then you have an explanation you can test that explanation and in most situation it turn out to be true even when you re not talking about politician and executive exclusively some example here http amptoonscomblogsomeevidenceofdiscriminationwagegapseriespart
AH because you re pretending like because i do nt know every single god damn so called benefit that automatically make me ignorant on the subject you re ignoring the fact that i have acknowledged and commented on each point you have made bring something new to the table or the door over there
NONE a a straight white conservative male i agree with you i wish more people in this new age of genderwhateverness realized that most of u are more accepting of them a they are it s this push back that pigeon hole people it s truly unnecessary i like you for you really so how do you accept u

NONE i m white so i do nt have culture but if i did i d be happy to share it with others the caveat is that they should be doing this in a positive way not in such a way that it is intended to minimize my culture
AH your reading comprehension is unfathomably bad and your ability to do basic google search even worse even though it is nt it s also woman with kid up to age i know which is why i said that the grand majority of people who qualify for wic are nt doing it based on the k number they re qualifying based on the k did it confuse you that i rounded instead of stating k or higher number proof i do nt know maybe the link that you gave to me http obamacarenetfederalpovertylevel or since you did nt bother to read that this link should help http lmgtfycom qobamacaresubsidies povertylevel an individual or family making between percent and percent of fpl may qualify for premium tax credit that is exactly my point but those solid income are just above poor no k k and up income are not just above poor these are folk that do have k in stock which i guess is your threshold for rich or something or will in a few year
NONE ok i ll play by your rule i ll even ignore the lost your job afterthefact you should have been prepared for such a possibility criterion which is clearly not an option with month left over your contention is it is moral for the median household in the us to have one child i ll give that to you month come to year so the break even point is i ll even spot you the and say that the break even point is k you can either afford to raise a kid or you ca nt that mean that if a couple make le than k a year it s immoral for them to have child that s your criterion so you are arguing that of household should not have a child that still mean that you are arguing that a household ha to be in the top of wage earner to morally have a child and essentially it s immoral for million people in the us to have child if you do nt see the absurdity of your own argument there s not much i can do to help you
AH the amazing irony of calling an american way of life inferior is fucking amazing to see here you really are an idiot
NONE it s a fucking flag i beleive in the dream but not the cloth better to be disrespectful than a liar with no integrity
AH there are rat more scary in ny than a xenomorph i understand you re trying to be funny but that s the stupidest thing i ve ever read and a disingenuous argument to make an individual xenomorph is capable of easily killing any unarmed human it come across and most armed human it come across you need serious firepower to kill a xenomorph much le an army of them
NONE you are forgetting one of the spear best asset and that is that it is much easier for anyone to use than virtually any other weapon even an idiot can be trained to stab with a spear all this nonsense about one on one combat is irrelevant duel virtually never occurred in battle this is why the spear wa so useful infantry fighting a a unit will always be more effective
AH and do nt worry i try not to take thing from stranger on the internet too personally who would have guessed that the person who wa being an arrogant prick in this thread would take an opportunity to rub it in after he s been apologized to tagged asshole you are aware that asking presumptive question in this way is rarely going to be received positively right of course you are you re an asshole
NONE of course it s not sexist further i would suggest that if somebody is cold they can put on a sweater i can not take off my skin if i m hot a i m not disagreeing with you at all i want to point out that people who paint this a an issue of sexism have it backwards the argument is sexist because the purveyor of it assume all male got together and voted to oppress woman via the air conditioning that s ridiculous
AH that wa almost coherent english bravo here s a sticker shaped like a star see the star s smiling at you
NONE lol that s it the bias on this entire subbreddit is too much for me at this point unsubbing cmv what a joke
AH why do nt you fuck off and swallow a grenade you subhuman piece of shit you and your kind are a pox on this earth and we d all be better off if you and everyone related to you wa dead i eagerly await your reasoned rational rebuttal to my idea i just expressed
NONE we re having a debate i m only commenting on what you ve said it s not up to me to try to comment on the spirit of your argument i ll use your logic and say that because you did nt argue your point effectively then you are nt entitled to your opinion anymore
AH antitrump than pro hillary however i m having a really hard time accepting that trumppence wa seen phuck off phaggt geyz is oppressd phucking idiot you have phagz fecophiles being granted legal sanction to mock marriage and engage in fraud by obunghole and somehow deyz oppresssssud just phuck off
NONE it s not even that given that the cmv is climate change is real and man made his argument is i m going to die one day so i do nt have the flu he doe nt even attempt to address the cmv it should nt be allowed and i m not sure why the mod have nt removed it given that it s a high level comment and clearly violates rule
AH except none of this is true you played the both party are equal game and they are profoundly not ignorant response

NONE that word is fucking stupid anyway
AH you stated that convervatism is based on where you are from no and that conservative are discriminated against also no you have nt presented any argument to back any of this up also no come back when you learn how to read
NONE no worry i should also add that it s important to be able to judge who to blame there are instance where you should take the blame and some others are to blame if you blame yourself when you re not to blame that s unhealthy
AH i give up i ve already explained how i used the figure for the sake of argument and i m not really suggest we use that figure it wa more a way of demonstrating how any activity that ha a high chance of resulting in death if you re denying that duelling to the death doe nt have a high chance of causing death then frankly you re an idiot and you re also an idiot if you re incapable of seeing why we should outlaw activity that are deadly to human that s exactly why we should outlaw them because they re deadly to human driving a car or playing football is nt a these both have incredibly low rate of death duelling to the death ha an incredibly high rate of death and you ll find very few other activity short of actively killing yourself that also have such a high rate of death you seemed to have ignored every other point i made relating to consent and being coerced into these activity and focused on the argument about whether or not deadly activity should be outlawed the point is that if you were to allow duelling to the death poor people might very well be coerced into duelling each other because of the promise of payment for their family would you seriously be okay living in a society that practised this
NONE but you are nt responsible for other people s action you can try to make amends for it because it help people but if that is the case why not make amends on behalf of human and not just black people sometimes this may mean you doing more and sometimes doing le but do you not this kind of identity is the reason civil right struggle were waged for in the first place if one insists on sticking to a racial identity it is definitely problematic your action might have more of an influence on the people around you instead of other people in your race for example perhaps you ought to be more concerned about their behaviour instead of the behaviour of other black people at an extreme this sort of closed identity can go down to your street or your building a well but it ha the flipside of excluding those outside of it i might be a bit meandering here but imagine that black people did tip more than the average or that you were white do you think you ought to give up on the idea of making amends for those who tipped le just because you were nt of the same race do you think a white person ought not to be concerned about a low average tip just because it wa black people who brought the average down
AH sorry survey say that you are incorrect http usnewsnbcnewscomnewsfirefighterslethomeburnoverfeeagain
NONE this might not belong here but your post reminded me of this video http myoutubecomwatch listpldfddfa vlfqvptvlmi
AH if you think sub should be banned based on decency there are thousand of sub like coontown waiting to be banned hating black people is okay but fat people hate is not decent you re probably a white fatty
NONE so which is it no one care whether you re transit s a nonissue or people do care so trans people should pretend until they graduate high school you ca nt have it both way and keep your original view
AH the rest of your comment is either mindless drivelnitpicking to the nth degree lol not it s not his comment wa precise correct and coherent your comment is what seems to be mindless drivel you ve insisted that the big bang theory ha anything to do with evolution by natural selection which are two completely separate theory and have nothing to do with each other they are two different framework to explain two different phenomenon your comment wa not needed in that sense lol the irony
NONE there s a great deal to be learned most of the world wa blindsided by trump s election and moment when your conception of reality is violently disturbed are by definition the moment when you need to learn the world is nt what you thought it wa and now you have to try and find out what it really is that may mean reevaluating political strategy changing rhetoric changing political goal in light of their practicability the only thing you should nt do is learn nothing ala that i have but one upvote to give for that statement
AH you re just being a dick actually
NONE you re right there is no changing it
AH i m not it should be taken more seriously legally by outlawing and helping the victim is poor sentence structure it implies that the outlawing and helping should both be applied to the victim assuming you believe otherwise the title should read it should be taken more seriously by outlawing the practice and helping the victim similarly are you sure they did nt circumcise your other head kidding
NONE so you re argument is that the freedom of slave owner were infringed upon and they were made angrier therefore it not only is a waste of time but a detriment to society your next point is a what if scenario that wo nt exist ever again in those country that have outlawed it i think a delta should go to the initial reply for sure
AH til that scientist just sit in arm chair and look at thing listlessly without ever making a decision and assuming that a code of conduct need to be accepted by people to be true is putting the cart before the horse in term of arguing for moral antirealism clearly a a moral realist i do not think that is the case so to think i will accept a definition that excludes moral realism by definition is exactly the kind of bullshit reasoning process you have used though out this entire discussion it s like you ve never read being and time or the philosophical investigation or something and if i had to choose between the sep and heidegger or wittgenstein i d chose the latter pair every single time
NONE the feeling i got from reading your argument wa that the term are nt the issue how we teach evolution is the issue get rid of the arrow drawing and people wo nt think we came from chimpanzee show a branching drawing instead fittest is a pretty good word to use he problem with it is that people do nt think about what it mean they just make an assumption that support their denial and carry on even if you changed the term those people are nt going to start studying what it mean they ll just fit it into their framework of denial in my cynical opinion if you change the term the new term would soon be bastardized and be in the same situation a the term we have now i am interested though got any idea for replacement term
AH what the fuck is wrong with you what kind of horrible thing to say is rape is worse because the victim survives this is tantamount to saying to rape victim man you would be so much better off if you were dead just go and kill yourself now no fuck you rape is traumatizing but death is the end when a person dy that s it they re gone there is no more that person there is no heaven no hell no afterlife where you can see them again what is wrong with you
NONE is this actually a stereotype whore talk too much i m not sure but i think talking like this can probably start a stereotype it s just using the word whore yeah in a negative context which implies that being a whore is a bad thing and thus perpetuates the idea in the public consciousness you would nt really say shut your captain america mouth or shut your miss universe mouth would you i think that sound wrong because ca and mu are usually positive stereotype
AH oh my god you actually ca nt read i am at this point amazed it feel like you are having a conversation with yourself cause none of this make sense or relates to thing i literally spelled out for you and seems you still didn t manage to comprehend the meaning of i am sorry i give up because it one thing to disagree it another thing to not even be able to understand the others view or word even something a simple a a clear statement i made you somehow managed not to grasp i honestly have no idea what is going wrong here or if you are at this point trolling since this is absurd
NONE example like all the star spelling something like i m god and i m here in a language that everyone understands cause trouble because it doe nt take long to come up with a cause that is necessarily more likely just like you do with your exmaple and the scientist one of the thing i think matt dillahunty doe get right is his reponse to that question i may not be able to articulate what the evidence would be that would convince me a god exists however any being that could qualify a a god know exactly what it would take to convince me and indeed could convince me so my not being convinced of it existence is either because it doe nt exist or it doe nt want me to know it exists
AH i respect your nativity at the very least so now people too poor to have the internet must go out of their way to vote who ha time to go to the library when you have kid and are too poor to afford a babysitter you are going home to feed your kid fuck going to the library now those people are nt represented the way the system currently work is that politician have staffer who read the law and tell the politician what is within them this work because there are nt that many law written under your plan anyone can write a law we ll need thousand of staffer reading and understanding these law regardless of how stupid they are who are these delegate maybe i m confused about this part of your plan how are they represented by who what are you talking about read any historian philosopher political scientist they ll tell you that s what democracy is about do nt be an annoying child and tell me that i need to fucking source my opinion on democracy that is held by way more people than your stupid liquid democracy optimism plan btw the constitution wa signed in how about you get your fact straight before you get snotty
NONE if you re waiting until you have a thorough understanding you re going to wait your entire life indeed the entire point of having a representative democratic government is that it allows u to hire specialist to deal with understanding those thing for u which free u up for more productive activity everyone doe this not just you all that matter is that you are educated enough to have opinion about the specific thing you actually care about voting for perhaps there s an antigaymarriage amendment in your state how do you feel about that if you do nt care that s fine but what would it take for you to consider yourself educated about such a basic moral principle whichever side you re on perhaps you do nt like your city councilperson because they voted against a park you wanted you do nt need any more reason than that to have a valid reason to vote and you do nt have to vote about the thing you arent educated about nor have an opinion about if you do nt want to just vote for the one that you do understand and take the time to become educated about these thing if everyone who is a responsible and reflective a you obviously are took your position and refrained from voting would the world be better off no because the only people that voted would be selfabsorbed flaky and irresponsible and so we would end up with a government by and for the irresponsible
AH this the delusion of trump follower this too is your rather sad delusion
NONE i lose a couple sense for whatever reason this is your strongest point yet
AH please do nt comment if you are too stupid to follow the conversation

NONE knowing the identity of the killerbad guy make me want to know howwhy he did the thing it creates an urge to know more about this character and i come back to my original argument this work for you but it doe nt work that way for a lot of people i m not saying that you re wrong or that they re right different stroke for different folk right
AH haha so i m a racist bigot for supporting trump being against illegal immigration say every god damn leftist you re a fucking idiot holy shit
NONE ok do people genuinly think that because they re a minority that they cant be racist that s one of the most ignorant thing i ve ever heard
AH are you suggesting that aave is a speech impediment the fact that you suggest that indicates you did nt bother to read what i wrote in the slightest either that or you lack even a modicum of reading comprehension which actually would make sense you re halfright that response make no sense in the context it wa used this is further evidence of poor language which would explain why you are having so much trouble with this and why you think grothman ha a speech impediment in the first place do you not understand what a premise is yes i do you on the other hand have proven you have little to no comprehension of both what i ve said and hilariously your own word so by all mean keep claiming i m ignorant while proving no point of your own if i did nt know better i would think you went to trump university but i think a part of their admission they are required to mention repeatedly that they attended that school
NONE then why call it privilege if we just want to acknowledge others have it worse why not just say they have it worse why frame what i have a undeserved privileged a in advantaged who said anything about undeserved i think you are perceiving an attack on you personally that just doe not seem to exist you were saying privilege equal agency yet now you say unprivileged are just having roadblock just because ben wear a red hat doe not mean all people with a red hat are ben i think you are making a huge leap in logic here just because people with privilege have considerable more amount of agency doe not mean that no minority are afforded any agency whatsoever i apologize if that is what i implied but that wa not my intent my only point wa to call out how disproportionate it is you just brought up something entirely new and suggested it a the solution so i m expected to write a dissertation in order to cover all possible outcome of conversation i think my post have been plenty long a it is
AH wow i wa hoping not to see your comment ever again you re that lunatic on reddit that constantly argues with people over anything i remember you calling some girl on rsoccer an attention whore when she proved you wrong you are truly an annoying person take that a a compliment
NONE just letting you know i wa one of those people that thought protesting wa pointless but after reading your post honestly i kind of get it now you worded this waaaayyy better than the people on twitter who when you ask them why they re protesting just call you an ignorant bigot
AH i guess though anyone with a brain should have lost faith in the american democratic process decade ago
NONE i do nt agree with people in prison being able to vote they lost that right when the broke the law
AH no one deserves it but do they deserve a replacement retard
NONE nobody is going to use this shit anyways shit doe nt matter
AH go troll someone else little guy your post history indicates that you enjoy it
NONE he s a murderer if anyone honestly tries to change your view god help them
AH that s the whole point of this thread dumbass
NONE i think there s a lot of troll in this thread
AH but to ban milo effectively for criticising a film and being right wing is absolutely fucking ludicrous good thing twitter never did that then is nt it in a statement twitter alluded about to the abuse directed at leslie jones but did nt refer to yiannopoulos directly people should be able to express diverse opinion and belief on twitter the statement read but no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online and our rule prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others over the past hour in particular we ve seen an uptick in the number of account violating these policy and have taken enforcement action against these accounts ranging from warning that also require the deletion of tweet violating our policy to permanent suspension twitter banned milo for inciting this abuse something that he quite clearly never did you failed to show that this is true you simply claim it is a someone on the left you re a liar i do nt believe you for a second case in point follows twitter ha effectively become a tyranny of the majority for leftist and sjws who seem perfectly fine to share a platform with isi recruiter but not those that disagree with them openly this is almost childish in it s hysterical overreaction but i guess it is at least nice that you admit that the right is nothing more than a cesspool of bigotry racism and paranoia since according to your own word banning racist bigoted hate speech is tantamount to banning the right he should not be held accountable for the action of troll and his opinion on politics and a film should not be ground for a ban no one care about milo s view on anything he s a glib and superficial narcissist milo wa rightly banned for brigading which will also get you banned from reddit
NONE they d be awful for activist in country where they re under threat but that s not really reddit s mo and i d call it disingenuous to argue otherwise this is not the only atrisk group and not the only group with a legitimate interest in anonymity consider rraisedbynarcissists a an example and i do nt think that it s the only sub for people in toxic relationship if you d id the people posting there they may often be in real danger from abusive relative there s also the various help with substance abuse sub where retaining anonymity help people come forward without the social pressure on them and get help if anonymity on reddit is not reliable all those group can essentially just close up i also disagree that the middle ground is reserved for lurker there s got to be more option than notoriety and karma whoring or use a new throwaway every time that still include being able to post such a a pretty normal account that just post something noteworthy and anything can turn out noteworthy ask anyone who wa turned into a meme once at this time i do nt believe anyone should expect to be able to express a nonanonymous opinion free of consequence and that a people believe they re anonymous here that belief is toxic to civil discourse i think now we re at the real meat you should not expect to remain anonymous in discussion about your beliefs while people are certainly more polite with their reputation at stake there s also considerable value in discussion that do nt get bogged down by the chilling effect http enwikipediaorgwikichillingeffect the demand for anonymous discussion is there and if you stifle the supply in the better location and yes i m including reddit into the better part of the internet the discussion just move to the socalled asshole of the internet that s how you get pol

AH so every black person ha sagging pant and is a thug this is the point i m trying to make not every black person is represented by a group of thug in my university every black person here is treated a equal to a white person there is not difference not every person in a group follows the culture i m a white girl and i ve never even heard of pumpkin latte fuck off with the stereotype yes maybe a few people of a million even a billion people have rioted but surely that doesnt mean they represent the entire culture
NONE there is a huge rift in our society this ha been the fundamental political topic since the emergence of the tea party if you think this social civil war is nt happening already then i m not sure what to say these attack are newsworthy but not a day go by where a gay person is nt beaten for being gay a black person for being black where a white person is pigeonholed for being a redneck where urban is assumed to mean something and rural another we can highlight this one because it is slight modification to the theme but the violence is ordinary unfortunately

AH it doe nt matter what the number is you have nt provided any evidence for your argument if the argument is we need to spend more on the military you need to show why that s the case and what we gain by spending more some of the navy s plane needing to be repaired or upgraded in order to be used is nt an argument that we need to be spending more wrong again you need enough to be able to withstand a first strike you have given no evidence for your position yet again i never claimed the number is the point is nt the number you have failed to demonstrate that nuke which is too low by the way is insufficient deterrence even if you did demonstrate that that still is nt evidence the us need to have the most nuke in order to achieve deterrence literally everything you write is completely irrelevant or wrong please tell me how of the navy s strike fighter not being ready for use prof that our money is most efficiently spent on the military and that you can conclude from that article that our military is weak and depleted what is of the navy s strike fighter are nt ready for use but the air force ha twice a many fighter a it did year ago what if we made improvement in other area what is the normal number of plane in our arsenal that are nt usable you have no idea how to even construct an argument
NONE on your point nuke we will have in the next year the ability to defeat icbm s it is not unthinkable that china russia and india will also have this ability in fact i would go so far a to say that any warhead capable of delivering a nuke at present size will be able to be defeated prior to detonation whether this is due to antimissile shield laser technology or targeted emp s it doe not matter once nuke are a nonfactor the single largest strategic problem with going to war with another country is gone state that do nt have to worry about their interest being nuked are much more likely to send the ground troop in on your point woman and the out of shape i see no reason that our current health problem will stop u from drafting people the training may be longer and more involved but where their is a requirement there is a way in the u military a for woman i look forward to the day woman are eligible for the draft but just because they are drafted doe not mean they will be automatically able or fit to do all job they will be assigned to the job that they can do well at on point co s you have to prove your co status this ha always been true access to info will only make people more ready for it but if more people out ov every do qualify you still have you can play with those number but i am not convinced that this is a problem that will completely negate the benefit a government would get out of a draft
AH so it is you who is the most retarded what are you going to tell yourself next that people are just jealous of you because they do nt believe you when you tell them sweden is the rape capital of the world they hate u bacause they anus for denying the holocaust and so on

NONE while a bit orthogonal to your argument i do nt think the term reverse racismsexism should be used it s all just racismsexism i agree that for example black can be racist against white but that should just be called racism not reverse racism having a different term for all the different type of racist thought only help those that want to legitimize their own prejudice a acceptable given the powerful connotation of the term racism a necessary first step towards legitimizing form of prejudice other than real racism are to distance themselves from that concept the phrase reverse racism implicitly acknowledges that there is a difference between that and real racism once that is accepted further conceptual distancing becomes possible

NONE is secondary school education too much to expect unfortunately it is too much to ask the average adult it too far in the past quick what is the atomic number of zinc you did know that in secondary school and on average people are nt good at math http educationnextorgwithamathproficiencyrateofpercentusranksnumber thirtytwo percent of us student in the class of were proficient in mathematics when they were in th grade according to the official u s report card on student achievement it give a good degree of accuracy for the minimal effort of reading a table a opposed to accuracy like we have now if you had access to the internet then you could get a tool to do this for you without secondary school education another hurdle for the poor that the rich do nt have tax are harder to figure out because i do nt have internet at home they could go to a library but they have the hurdle of doing tax at a certain place and time yes it is a more complicated system but i do nt think it is so complicated that it would be a major downside again for what so the rich ha a percentage that is different from the even richer is this a problem that we need a more complicated system to solve
AH colonization is the term for taking land correct it s not the term for establishing a nation in legally obtained land north america s colonization also had legal justification doe nt change it from being colonization your antisemitism is clearly influencing your opinion yeah you can fuck right off with that bullshit i m not wasting my time using slimy tactic like that just because i point out that israel doe fucked up thing doe nt mean i hate jew

NONE if someone s year old son becomes horribly deformed due to some accident get burned or loses his arm or leg or becomes blind etc i m not talking about these kind of deformity what would you do with a fetus without a brain indicates that you are not motivated by what is good for the child and their life quality but rather by what is more comfortable for the people who have to take care of these child would you want to live with a daily reminder of your rape in my mind this exceed just unwanted it would be emotionally and psychologically crippling to many
AH uh then you re beyond help
NONE i ca nt because you re right
AH beyond this stronger libertarian would argue that it should be legal for minor to use drug the idea of decriminalizing controlled substance ha much broader support than your caricature of fairly fringe political subgroups sure there s always someone you could point to who s going to have made any given argument no matter how unreasonable but why even bring that up it s a trivial argument from a trivial mind i simply restated the ops argument that i agree with that effort should be put towards rehabilitation rather than decriminalization not sure if this is a typo these two thing are not at odds and replacing decriminalization with rehabilitation whatever the fuck that mean is not what op wa suggesting or are you arguing that no one ha drug issue i can tell logic is nt your strong suit but you should understand that in syllogistic logic not all are is not the same a all are not indeed the negation of all are is not all are rather than all are not my assertion that it is possible is not even close to an assertion that no one is addicted i honestly ca nt understand if you actually think those two sentiment are the same or if you think that equating them rhetorically is a form of argument either way you re wrong i ca nt find any stats for drug incarceration of possession v trafficking but i do know that of all arrest are for possession only you misunderstood i wa nt asking for your input i wa providing you with insight only a very small percentage of all arrest result in a prison sentence and anyone who know how criminal justice in the u operates know this you clearly do not
NONE you know op i agree with your basic conclusion pretty much entirely antiabortion folk in general are very misguided regarding abortion and inconsistent with their belief regarding the sanctity of life however i think either you put too much emphasis on this priority thing or you are trying to make a point that is not entirely clear to everyone here i can believe two thing to be equally abhorrent and support neither of them even though the concession of one would help with the other taken to the extreme the way you have phrased this priority thing it seems like anytime anybody doe nt devote literally of their effort to stopping something they think need to be stopped then they do nt really think it need to be stopped i think you would have a better time pulling up polling data or appealing to common sense about other way in which prolife argument are inconsistent in the grand scheme it s not that the priority argument is wrong it s perfectly reasonable to assume that people have priority for everything they do and believe and operate generally within those line it s just not fully convincing i mean taking a look at my own life i think drunk driver are bad and if we just reenacted prohibition we could stop like of drunk driver the nsa would make prohibition a little more effective this time around but i also think this is a super stupid idea doe that mean i prioritize getting totally wasted above poor innocent pedestrian dying no it mean i m not willing to fully concede one thing i believe in order to kinda have an effect on something else i believe in
AH your side suck more statistically and this is not surprising now you have just made an incorrect assumption about me which is not surprising given your onedimensional viewpoint
NONE my argument here is it isnt sexist because you can always add more layer but there is a point in which you cant remove any more of them so going colder is always better
AH bro you are so far gone it s unreal jew do not control the world you have no evidence to back up any of your claim you re just looking for a group of people to blame for bad thing that happen in the world and it s super easy to point the finger at the people that look different or are part of a large religion with loose tie to the one i m sure you re a part of it s not fair and it s not realistic at all just think about the fact that there are bad people from all walk of life all skin color all religion and those few people are what s driving your disdain for enormous group of people it just doe nt make sense to apply those kind of blanket opinion by your login i could say white people are the reason the economy tanked but see it sound ridiculous when you say it because it s not true white people a a whole did nt tank the economy because the vast majority of leadership at the time were white just like black people or latino people are nt inherently criminal even though a a percentage of their ethnicity many do commit crime again it go back to economic class poor people commit crime and get caught up in the judicial system because they need money rich people commit crime and arguably get off because they re rich just try and reframe your mind to look at people s action in an economic sense why are minority le healthy the cheapest food are nt healthy this help explain the diabetes issue why are they on welfare and medicaid because healthcare is expensive it make unfortunate that society ha evolved to a point where color can dictate how much money you make it should nt but it doe you ca nt hold a group of people down and then bitch when they do nt act like you want them to ie live a healthy lifestyle accept they wo nt be able to have a big tvxboxbrand new car a a society on a systematic level we do nt allow them the opportunity to obtain the wealth needed to get those thing
NONE poor people when you know they re poor and some people can hide that easier than those who ca nt change the color of their skin once you ve frozen them out of any path in legitimate society you ve taken away any incentive they have to participate the only thing they can still lose is their life or the life of those they love but since there s no ability to progress they just survive you deal drug because you need to put food on the table or because it s the only mean of having the lifestyle everyone else take for granted there s no shame in taking a government check because no one want to let you work a meaningful job anyway why flip burger for an hour when you get no more respect from society than if you deal drug shit when you re not at work people treat you like you deal drug anyway shit when you are at work people assume you deal drug when you re not at work you ll never get a nice office from society never drive a nice car never buy a nice house so fuck them they want your loyalty to and compliance with a system that doe nt even offer you a place much le a benefit so you live outside their boundary and rule right where they put you and you do nt hesitate to lash out at them the question wa related to black culture but it s just the most homogenous group of disenfranchised citizen and thus the easiest to discus look at catholic in northern ireland the highland scottish appalachia native american plenty of example throughout history and geography of every color and creed build enough of them and you get a revolution which people would be wise to remember a fewer and fewer people have a meaningful place in our social structure
AH til uantihexe is a perpetual victim and pointing out the fact that their culture argument is not only played out but it is also ignorant of african american history is victim blaming and gaslighting im sorry that the truth hurt

NONE i agree with you i call my friend hoe in a playful manner and vice versa but if a guy said it to me in a hateful way i would be upset i say fuck all the time but if someone i admire screamed fuck you at me i d be hurt it make absolutely no practical sense that we should start saying the n word and it s very telling that content cop is white and all the comment i ve seen agreeing with him are probably white too since i m pretty sure you d want to specify if you were black to gain some leverage when stating an opinion like that
AH obvious difference in iq and what not when people speak of obvious difference in iq of people s race it usually tell me how disappointingly intelligent this person is or rather the lack of which i feel like the kind of person who would say such a thing is a the person i could sell shit folded in a waffle and call it an ice cream cone
NONE a statistical difference between class of people is not a reason to universally reject them if you knew absolutely nothing about someone except their religion then the statistic can be relevant but fortunately you can interview and see the qualification of a person so that you can judge them a an individual and not just a a religious person
AH a soon a you tell me that a quote by someone in office a half century ago is relevant i await your informed mature detailed response

AH this is probably the single most racist thing i ve ever read on reddit i especially liked your imagined dialogue where mike brown who would have started college yesterday can barely string together a coherent sentence while the white police officer spoke with impeccable grammar and restraint would read again do you honestly expect serious answer after this post if so i d suggest you delete this and just try again
NONE i m a social psychologist my colleague and i used these word a lot i have no trouble mixing them up i ve never seen anyone else get it wrong and i do nt hear anyone talking about how annoying it is to remember unlike say not using data a singular this seems to be the kind of thing that s not actually very easy to get wrong maybe after an initial minor hump
AH is this why you have come to rchangemyview is this really the best you have
NONE why would i want to change this view it s a great one and more people should think like this
AH i think you re digging a hole here and since this interaction is nt really serving to benefit the issue being discussed in this thread and yours ha your failure to realize what subreddit you were in resulted in your own confusion and you have still yet to claim ownership of it
NONE no worry it s more about being productive in your argument than being polite while i understood the argument of your original post i d be muchless likely to take it in if i were op your edit is much more palatable and the op might be morelikely to understand your intent cheer
AH define fascism if you use a word you should prove you know what it mean yeah fdr wa so terrible how dare he do more than anyone else to bring job tom people boost our economy and help keep american taken care of what a terrible president fuck off troll
NONE it s you could be the way you carry yourself how you dress your physical stature but out of all the people your assailant could have victimized they chose you perhaps stop worrying about who you should fear and figure out why they do nt fear and respect you enough to not mess with you
AH so you re a racist i ve found that it pretty hard to change a racist s view especially through an online message board carry on but you should nt be a racist i think white country are for white people black country are for black people and asian country are for asian why why not make all country for all people
NONE also just to add if i m really wealthy and own a business on paper i may make very little i ve seen people who make yearly yet they are obviously millionaire and in the range even the modestly wealthy are able to income split and use other tax advantage also what about the child of rich kid that are in school not working
AH that must be it from the mouth of idiot and child i suppose it could nt be that it s sailed over your head it s clearly far too big for that

NONE you may not see a problem with it but your stated view wa specifically that you wanted to teach history i ve established and it seems that you have conceded that what you want is not history but instead revisionist propaganda that make your people look better it seems like this would be a change in your view even a minor one do nt bother with a delta though i do nt want one coming from a nazi it would just feel dirty
AH why should our friend do that other than for getting a political science degree why should our friend do that political science is not a science in the sense that physic or biology or chemistry are oh i know it s not a science it s one of the social science that latch onto real science for credibility think they are going for respectability by association eg thing that were thought of a correct when i wa born may not be thought of a such right now in political science amazing you must be really smart but the law of gravity is still the same carbon still ha proton etc and america wa still founded in abraham lincoln is still the th president etc i guess you need to retake your physic class the law of gravity ha changed over time but i get your point whereas the prevailing political orthodoxy ha changed from keeping marginal tax rate high to cutting them and it will swing back you need to take philosophy of science that s not why political science and science is different simplistically speaking it s a matter of the application of scientific method just like with economics psychology etc scientific method is not applied in political science
NONE it seems to me you re criticizing a way of discussing politics in class not the concept of doing so what you ve described is a symptom of a certain political pathology in the u both side i consider myself progressive in most respect but this is just a common on my side of the debate a the other side demonize their political opponent to an unreasonable degree we human scientist researcher etc know that the vast majority of human being construct narrative for themselves that make them the good guy in our society i do nt see it a possible to avoid discussing politics because so many topic are politicized teaching science you re taking a political position discus health care in any fashion political discus sex education political bullying should nt be allowed and your example certainly take it too far but it s a quantitative difference not a qualitative one there is no debate to teach when it come to certain facet of science what you describe is extreme polarization and it should be avoided but to avoid all political discussion in our country would require a damaging scouring of subject matter that would significantly reduce the quality of education available
AH i m not sure if you re a troll or trying to be sarcastic but please read up on this article http wwwtheatlanticcombusinessarchiveblackshispanicsmortgages if you genuinely think black people or hispanic are nt systemically oppressed

AH loehmann order tamir to show his hand from inside cruiser a garmback raced toward tamir loehmann ordered tamir three time to show his hand according to the police account of the incident the command were given through the cruiser s passenger side door loehmann cracked open a they rushed the boy tamir reached for his waistband and loehmann sprang out of the passenger seat and immediately opened fire tamir fell to the ground before garmback left the cruiser it is unclear if tamir heard or understood the command which could have been given through an external megaphone if the car wa so equipped the division s useofforce policy lack guidance on verbal command method the justice department took issue with the entire document the policy in place at the time of our investigation wa confusing at time conflicted with the law and did not provide sufficient guidance to officer according to the justice department letter many officer reported to u that they did not understand the policy and more generally did not understand what level of force they were permitted to use under what circumstance fuck your klan cracker
NONE i ca nt find anything saying that the officer were police officer if they were tso s they are not police and are not authorised to make arrest or use force in order to perform their duty if it is indeed the case that the security official were transportation security official then it is not illegal to resist their application of force a they are not authorised to do so in the first place additionally the man would be justified in resisting this application of force by unqualified and unauthorised officer if it is the case that the officer were police officer then your point still stand even if the officer were police officer we should first ask if the officer responded appropriately before we push the blame solely onto the passenger if it is the case that the officer responded disproportionately out of protocol or in escalation then the officer are also held partially accountable for any injury resulting from their action a an extreme example to illustrate the point if an officer began to beat someone for jaywalking with a baton even if the jaywalker resisted the beating the officer is still held responsible for a portion of the injury

NONE all i demand is an earnest genuine effort to improve unless we re talking about someone with whom you have some sort of dependent relationship with who the fuck are you to demand anything of anyone i do indeed have a problem with a person that is unwilling to try recognizing a problem even a major character flaw or weakness can happen independent of casting judgement that i believe myself a final arbiter of other people morality you re cmv state that it is a moral imperative you have said numerous time in this cmv that people have a moral obligation to themselves you are absolutely and with out a shadow of a doubt judging the morality of others we all make evaluation of how people behave and whether they are doing right this can be done without invoking morality i do it every damn day

NONE sound to me like you re a sufferer of social anxiety aka social phobia perhaps you also lie somewhere on the autism spectrum i am also diagnosed social phobic so i feel your pain buddy afaik it s one of the most underdiagnosed mental issue i ll say to you what i ve said to other sufferer of this arsehole of a condition it s not your fault i know when our go to a party or social gathering and you sit in the corner quietly you​ hate yourself for it you lambaste yourself for being weak and pathetic i know because i do this too i ll ask you this if you were watching a race between four able bodied athlete and one guy who s missing a leg and ha a shitty prosthetic not one of those cool blade thing would you think of the one legged guy a weak for coming last or would you think of him a brave and awesome for just taking part it s the latter is nt it that s what people like you and i are we re the one legged guy we might come last but the mere fact we left our front door that morning and faced the world is an amazing feat in and of itself extrovert and normal wo nt get it because when they look at u they just see a normal person with no disability but frankly they can go fuck themselves they ll never understand what we go through on a daily basis you re not worthless a a bf or a a person in fact you ve got a strength that even you re not aware of

AH to me it looked like hillary is being shoved down my throat lol she wa nt she could nt even fit into your mouth much le be shoved by a third person into your throat what you thought wa happening wa not happening and in your confusion you voted a tv game show host president how dumb lol much dumber than anything i ve done for instance next time work on separating fantasy from reality adult are expected to do this
NONE by this same reasoning someone should nt ever cry over a fictional story ever either i mean those people and situation are nt even real at least with sport it s something you put effort in only to lose you ca nt even have any impact at all on an already written story so it make even le sense to cry over it you ever get emotional over a story congratulation you ve had an even bigger overreaction than an athlete whose just lost a game
AH spoken like a true altright shit for brain
NONE sound like something a lazy person would say
AH for instance the supreme court i m thinking of the french equivalent the conseil constitutionnel could decide so again you re putting power to decide who get to vote in the hand of a small group of people and hoping that they do nt abuse that power a said somewhere else i have to hope those person have good intention sadly every system is based on this and what you re missing is that your system increases the risk of this but consolidating voting power into an ever smaller group of people and worse is doing so in an entirely subjective manner it d be one thing if your criterion were objective eg college degree x year of military service etc but you re basically allowing individual to make an entirely subjective judgement a to who get to vote or not and then pretending they wo nt abuse that power to reduce the risk of this you could interview those people not by a single person but a small jury and who get to decide the jury not to mention now you ve made the administration of the problem worse since now you have to get an entire jury of people together to decide to get to vote and trying to get that system to work across an eligible base of around million people first i wa thinking of france so now you re moving the goalpost but you still have around million eligible voter to deal with and you seriously want to do this for every single issue that s not national security related are you nut of course it would be a massive process but i do nt think it s impossible and what if it s for the best of our nation and who get to decide what s in the best interest of the nation if not the nation itself a an aside i find it hilarious that you ve so smugly put gun right a a moral issue that france rightly abolished and yet it s far easier for a criminal to get an automatic weapon in france than it is in the u
NONE have followed the relevant law what law are these who get to write them are they also subject to change like a normal law or do they require the extra effort of a constitutional amendment go to a popular vote and need a margin to pas this personally seems like a terrible idea you can get of the population to agree on almost anything if they are scared or misinformed enough the constitution protects u against making panicked decision that undermine the entire backbone of our country being a this is a year cycle i do nt think it would be unreasonable for this process to take a year or more i think you re being optimistic about how much time money and confusion it would cost to rewrite all of federal law in the face of a new constitution every legal decision would have to be revisited thing like brown vs board of education or roe vs wade would no longer be valid legal opinion this is an underhanded way to eliminate legal restriction on thing a special interest group might want dissolved without actually having to make people think directly about that thing like if you are playing chess and you fork an opponent s piece the piece you re directly threatening is nt the one you re going after and you leave them no choice sometimes but to accept the loss this is a dangerous power to give politician in an age where disinformation and noisetosignal ratio are at an all time high though in fairness that s exactly what happened the first time we got lucky that the document wa written during a time when those people in charge had just fought a long bloody war specifically against tyranny this is reflected in it many protection against just that tyranny i do nt trust soft influential modern politician to maintain that moral and legal hard edge in perpetuity this seems way more dangerous than any potential benefit we could get out of it
AH people only troll this hard when they know they are wrong keep it up you re doing a great job of changing people view to the pro gun side
NONE work is nt the case at all it can still be fun getting to know people a bit even if you are nt going to spend the rest of your life with someone
AH islamic terrorism caused this no islam is detrimental to woman s right and religious freedom no because most leftist medium outlet will flat out refuse to say such thing because they want to be politically correct this is a standard reactionary bromide a ridiculous idea dripping from an empty mind the point that you are missing is far more subtle which is that we want to avoid inflammatory language the language of war this is a practical consideration we do not want islamist to be able to use our word to fan the flame of hatred against u of course it is the case the radical islamic terrorism exists this is uncontroversial using that term in a rhetorical context conducive to war is what is being avoided what are your thought on saying undocumented people instead of illegal immigrant i think undocumented people affords the people at question more human dignity and is therefore the better construction or what about the complete censoring of the term islamic terrorism and it is always said a terrorism i ve addressed this idiotic concern above
NONE i think this post is just evidence that you do not actually understand the law there are country with literal blasphemy law but those do nt seem to be what you are talking about it is not illegal to criticize religion you can rip into the doctrine of christianity islam or judaism all day every day and never trip an alarm what doe is when it reach the point of promoting hatred of practitioner a a whole that is a very high bar to meet one you basically have to be trying to meet you can not say that all muslim are violent rapist the problem with hate speech is that it is a type of speech that actively intimidates people away from engaging in both the discourse and in society a a whole it s an intimidation tactic one that actively poison discourse and ha a chilling effect on speech a a whole who is going to risk open debate with group that imply nothing short of hatred is justified freedom of speech need to consider the reasonable effect of speech and allow for the fact that some speech is objectively harmful that is why threat are not protected speech
AH because the social construct argument is dishonest and stupid not to mention rooted in marxist ideology do nt believe me look at the people who advance that shit at root it s about blaming white people or western civ because black or other minority people have issue unique to them white do too in fact i d argue that the problem u white have is quite more dangerous because we re readily destroying our civilization in the name of ideology ca nt fault the black on doing that really look race exists and that s pretty obvious different group have different phenotype and more i m not even really interested in arguing iq but the data support different group having different iq eastasians having the highest on average look dude i m one of the founding coontown mod and i think the whole different specie idea from the op is a load of shit clearly we re all human but we re humans with differences and that s okay funny anecdote out of nowhere a black friend of mine texted me the day after coontown got banned on how bullshit it wa a black friend who is female eat your heart out motherfucker
NONE i did nt move the goal post in my original comment i said pretty explicitly that the nword rose out of slavery which is part of what make it particularly bad cracker is rude to say too but the reason it s not a bad is that it doe nt remind white people of how their grandparent were whipped beaten and raped by human owner that s what the nword doe there s a fairly large ethical difference there yes different slur have different history so yes they have different level of hate shock value and stigma attached to them the u slave trade is one of the largest if not the largest in u history lasting a very long time and with a catastrophic human cost in term of number of people kidnapped murdered or made to suffer so a word associated with it naturally ha more anguish associated with it than cracker which is nt a polite word but is nt literally rooted in a time when white people were sold for profit anyway a i said part of my argument is you should nt say slur in general i do nt understand why people are so self righteous about wanting to get away with using vile slur
AH be nice or we are done here you make a bullshit statement to dishonestly imply something i clearly did nt say then tell me to be nice or we are done here when i point out that it s a bullshit statement we re done here peddle your bullshit elsewhere

NONE what i m saying is you should nt say this is what racism mean and therefore i can get anything i want to be racism by only applying my carefully constructed definition to every situation you should ask what is meant when someone say racism and then ask if that definition is sensible and applicable in the context of whatever situation you re interested in
AH answer literally any of those question and we can talk otherwise i will continue thinking you re brainwashed p i met people at my top uk university who were pursuing engineering degree and believed dinosaur fossil were placed there by god to test our faith so yes you can be an engineer and fucking retarded
NONE probably half the population could become astrophysicist if they wanted that being said there were many student in my class at university who dropped out because they simply could not handle the technical stuff these were not lazy people at all and not idiot either this is exactly what i wa trying to say
AH i mean hillary would probably not be that much better than trump if a happened but honestly the reason i am being so realistic is because i do nt understand policy i just do nt part is why you mistakenly believe part one party is literally falsifiably dumber than the other they are nt allowed to believe in science evolution climate change and they have to at least pretend that the world began with adam and eve taking instruction from a talking snake they re just genuinely a dumber party demonstrably with evidence they were in charge for year and the country went to shit this is nt hyperbole we literally started at surplus and ended at great depression part i understand the notion of how much damage could trump do really and the answer is if he get uneventful bill clinton year maybe not much but if he get george w bush year probably enough damage to have your as still bitching about it when you re this shit is not a game it s not cute it s not entertaining it s boring it s important and if you re coming at it from a childish ignorant angle it s better for all of u yourself included if you sit this one the fuck out my argument is basically that trump is so stupid he wo nt be able to be stupid make you sound fucking stupider than him if you think he s so stupid do nt put him in charge of the life of my cousin or any of our military serviceman you asshole have a little empathy
NONE there s a big distinction that you seem to be glossing over what kind of company am i in when i say this i joke about shooting and death and terrorist attack all the time i might make a dead baby joke with my boyfriend but i would never say one in front of a person who lost a young child or even among a crowd i am not sure about when i make fun of a tragedy among people who i know wo nt be hurt by it there is no direct harm being caused i do nt see what is bad about that it make you look unsympathetic even if you believe you are this may seem judgemental but it s hard not to be so you are making yourself look very unkind if you make these joke i completely accept that a person might think that when i say such a joke that s why i take care to only say such thing around people that i know will be okay with it you either think that innocent people dying wa a sad event or a funny event joking about tragedy replaces mourning and vice versa i can think an event wa horrible while still make joke about it it might seem odd to you but laughing at a joke about an event doe nt mean i think the event itself wa funny joke often work by being unexpected or wrong in some manner it s that aspect of the joke not the event itself that is funny it s what make murderersterrorists thrive people who do these thing do nt do them a a joke terrorist mean to incite terror if they bring humor and laughter they did nt do what they wanted
AH men s room still do have stall well while not universal there is a general rule that you should nt poop in urinal that s why we named them is using tampon a prerequisite for using the woman s restroom no it is an indicator of the biological design element of bathroom it doe not support the idea that transgender people should be forced to use the bathroom that match their biological sex forced is such a strong word yet generally speaking a man is forced to use the men s room should a man who emotionally feel like a woman or vice versa not be forced to use the men s room i have already disagreed with this in another comment saying that biologic use is f the utmost importance ie use the wrong restroom instead of pooping your pant however should a man who emotionally feel like woman or vv be privileged to use either restroom without a biological emergency absolutely not they are misusing a room designed around biology for their own emotional need i also wonder how you feel about the existence of unisex restroom anyone can use unisex restroom they are not designed around exclusive biological need
NONE in that case you could have a situation where a person is utilizing an inappropriate public shower by simply saying i m am trans in other word a ci male could walk into the woman s shower at the local ymca or city pool and view naked woman while also parading around with a dick wobbling about in front of woman and perhaps young girl i m trying to understand why someone who doe nt believe a trans person is trans feel the need to air that view given that it doe nt seem to benefit them in this case bringing attention to hey there s a dude with a dick in the woman s shower and my year old daughter wa in there would benefit the person because in all likelihood a person in authority possibly the police would make a determination a to whether or not the trans person s presence in the woman s locker room wa appropriate or not whether it is enacting law or simply determining how society address and treat transgender individual nothing can be determined unless transgender is clearly defined in a way that make logical sense and a man simply claiming to feel like a woman today and being protected under the same provision designed to protect legitimate transgender individual doe nt make logical sense
AH there s no blood on my hand i m no more responsible for those killed by gun then you are for people who could have been saved by them you re just a childish little prick and i wo nt bother responding to you further
NONE i m a pacifist myself and would never let a shot get fired if i were president just bluffing bluff only work when people do nt know you re bluffing if you never make good on threat of force no one will take them seriously
AH you had me on your side of the argument until you said people who did nt go to college there are plenty of people who dont have a degree but make per year dont conflate education with intelligence it just make you look like a twat
NONE the movement overall could be a good thing but from what i have seen most of the people involved are practicing reverse racism i have had people bring the moment up to me and i say yeah all life should matter and they yell at me
AH people have free will kid have the absolute option even if taken to church by their parent to not listen or not believe or to critically analyze the information they are receiving ahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaahahahahah ha haha ha oh thank you friend i needed a laugh today please do nt take this the wrong way a i do nt want to sound confrontational but are you a student of sociology social psychology or neurology at all because each and every one of those field disagrees with your statement child are not in general predisposed to critical evaluation of shit their parent tell them hell most adult are not predisposed to critical informed evaluation of whatever social bias were imparted on them during their formative year if they were we d see massive dieoffs of religious hoopla a people realized wait what s more likely that the law of the universe were broken a couple of time by an interventionist deity who favor whichever side is telling the story or that a bunch of people made some shit up to add legitimacy to their bullshit a ha been the case for untold generation of human picked b and said welp shit dunno why i believed in burning bush spaghetti monster turban pedophile oneeyed viking aligatorheaded death god for so long human are social animal and most human do nt want to rock the boat
NONE is most of the trauma simply caused by people reaction rather than the crime itself it s both the crime creates the first trauma people s reaction to that crime recreate that trauma plus multiply trauma on top of it for example imagine telling the survivor of an attempted homicide that they need to try strangulation again with someone they love it can feel wonderful after all despite the risk associated with it alternatively imagine telling anyone who nearly died in a car crash that wanting to drive again wa proof they alone were responsible for the accident or that there wa no accident at all both metaphor apply to the experience of being a rape victim then there s the way in which society in general handle sex in some place it s a taboo which mean it s everywhere but you re not allowed to speak of it imagine if instead of sex it wa spider imagine a world where people hide spider underneath their clothes you can see them moving sometimes sometimes they want you to see them moving imagine the shadow of spider sold perfume or fashion or car imagine if there were web all over billboard and magazine stand all to sell thing to people who like spider but you re not allowed to mention it if you do it must mean you re obsessed with spider and if you re obsessed with spider people ca nt be blamed if their spider bite you have any of these metaphor helped
AH this is the fucking stupidest argument i have ever read a person who ha the genitalia that match their outward appearance is a ci person their sex is their sex regardless of what they say their identity is right their gender identity trans or ci ha nothing do with sex right so you re saying that a person who wa born with the correct genitalia and the correct identity ha anything to prove the burden of proof is on the plaintiff
NONE it s really a toss up to argue that someone with this feeling ha something wrong with their mind or something wrong with their body science doe show that statistically speaking transgender people have brain structure more similar to the gender they perceive themselves to be than to the sex they were born with so we re left with the conclusion that their problem is that there is a mismatch between the brain they re born with and the body they are born with it s not strictly a mental issue nor is it strictly a physical issue it s a conflict between the two
AH just a short easy comment i m a student in an engineering field saying i m ignorant because i went to well fargo is pretty ignorant in and of itself the idea that because i needed money for school and they were the one who provided i m suppose to think hey this big corp is going to fuck me over at some point just like all big corp is pretty moronic a i ve never had anything like this happen in my entire life
NONE so i ve been reading this thread and it s clear that most people are american at what point in the life of an american child are they taught to anticipate gunman it appears that this is pretty much on the syllabus and it seems really damn weird i m from europe and i wa when the dunblane massacre happened it wa nt in my country admittedly but it got a lot of coverage however we were nt taught this could happen to you
AH you re talking out your as dude vague statement of principal with no explanation or support needing clearly doe not equal deserving especially when you include the interest of people who worked to create something for money and the existence of poor creator and it s hard to argue that someone need music book or movie a significant proportion of people who pirate do in fact have the disposable income to purchase the medium they pirate and still make end meet they choose not to i strongly suspect you fall into this category a i have explained making copy and distributing them without permission take value from the creator even if they have some money already it hurt them hurting someone else because you do nt have a direct incentive not to is the definition of immoral behavior we re not talking about sharing book we are talking about making copy and distributing them without the creator s permission everyone ha the moral right and several people have the legal right to tell you not to do that seriously you re not making coherent or clever argument you re just waving around pseudointellectual statement like you re trying to signal you re some kind of big intellect and it s not working
NONE another interesting issue is just how many people mistake how much they love doing a particular thing with how much they like the idea of doing it or the title or other perk plus not recognizing what it actually take to monetize it which often involves a bunch of unrelated stuff that can suck the joy out of it or simply not be worth the trouble vs keeping it a hobby many people pursue a romantic career only to find what people actually pay them for is the really boring part of it and not the more creative work they d hoped they d be doing i do nt think it s wrong to be concerned about people spending ton of money on this just that it s too extreme to say people should nt major in these field fewer people should major in them probably though and fewer people should expect to get a career doing what they love it s more important that you do something you do nt hate i think there are all sort of pro and con to various job that do nt get considered that matter more when it come to suiting a person s personality high stress vs low pleasant ambienceenvironment exerciseactivity level amount and type of social interaction moreless ordered workload moreless hierarchical employee structure and so on
AH it s not my fault that your concept of god is dimwitted you have simply redfined universe a god what is so divine about a god like this the energy within your brain make you conscious god is all energy therefore god is conscious this is logic fail on so many level i would not know where to begin you clearly ca nt fathom any type of concept of divinity other than the western religion you were bombarded with growing up i certainly can but your supposed god is kind of stupid
NONE your statement is sort of useless because god mean so many different thing to different people the statement becomes hopelessly vague because alice and bob can hold vastly different belief which can both be summed up in the statement i believe god created the universe from where i stand what you are really saying is if you believe god can be anything and you have no clue what god is then there is no difference between believing you do nt know how the universe came in to being and believing that god brought the universe in to being it really becomes a question of definition which in this case is entirely subjective you can probably find a formal definition for god which make your statement true but it will still not reflect actual people s actual belief
AH man reading sure is hard for ammo fetishist is nt it no my point is that you wo nt have practiced so it wo nt have actually mattered pulling your gun out of your pocket in front of a mirror at home is wildly different than pulling it out aiming it and firing at someone who s firing back at you the effect of adrenaline are not in any way negligible
NONE if you step on my foot it doe nt matter if it wa an accident or if it wa nt intentional you re still on my foot it still hurt and you still need to get off of it and if we re in a wide open space where your only excuse to have stepped on my foot or be anywhere near it is complete carelessness i ll blame you and call you out on your carelessness
AH so human life should have never existed come on this is such an absurd and pathetic view if your life is so full of suffering why are you still here typing this nonsense why have nt you ended your life because of said suffering there is obviously some kind of redeeming quality that is more important than suffering for you to be here
NONE there s no point in trying to change your view because climate change is real and human are causing it there is no doubt about it there is so much evidence to support it the thing is is that if we do nt do anything about it the earth will warm so much even human will stop existing and so will life a we know it
AH what make the american democratic experiment so historically important is that it s the first country to formally recognize that the legitimacy of government come from the people being governed the fuck are you talking about is this really what they teach you in school
NONE the very problem with appropriation is that the minority culture is absorbed by the majority divisiveness is the very point they are saying they want their culture and do not want to be a part of the majority it is about maintaining segregation of culture something i think that is nt a benefit to society
AH i m going to use your need to make an ad hominem attack a my cue to exit take care
NONE you should probably get me drunk before you try to make ridiculous argument like that
AH what i have nt seen any from the admins wait what we ve laid the evidence out in front of you but because it did nt come from the mouth of reddit admins it s not good enough you do nt think maybe that s just a little bit silly dude you lost the argument but you keep trying to reframe the term to compensate just be an adult already and admit you re wrong
NONE meh some people do nt like it you seem ok with it i could nt give le of a shit if i tried are people not allowed to have opinion on shit are you required to have an opinion on everything that come across your path to me there is nt a single aspect to this story that is nt kinda stupid the poster is kinda dumb it s dumb to get upset over a dumb poster it s dumb to get upset about people getting upset over a dumb poster cheerleading is dumb too
AH dude check your moral compass it s not supposed to spin freely
NONE why would we need to change your view this is sanity go you
AH well he s facing societal disadvantage but you ve just dismissed them a disadvantage that are nt of primary importance for no reason other than that his race is nt the one you think is most important oppressed or disadvantaged all the while failing to acknowledge him a an individual human we re in a thread specifically talking about racial inequality if you wan na talk about class inequality on reddit make a new thread indeed it is you ve just used the last commenter s race to dismiss his problem and disadvantage indeed to ignore another form of inequality alright look here i just dismissed his point because this topic is about race look at the title again cmv statement from the peter liang protest such a white privilege mean that they have a sense of superiority and supremacy and they want to be put above the law are objectively racist and should be condemned a such is this about class no seriously stop with the red herring dangerous ground tread carefully there are no positive philosophical outcome from holding such a position using a red herring to distract from the main topic is not productive in discussion
NONE the problem is that especially on the more explicitly viewpointdriven sub like rsocialism or rlibertarian there are certain precept which are taken a simple fact arguing against those such a taking an antinap or government threat of jail if you break the law is not aggression position on a libertarian sub would be like speaking to someone who denies something you take a fundamental for an easy example imagine trying to talk about psychology with someone who belief in phrenology not just impossible to make headway but fundamentally a waste of time the issue is that these issue have all been debated and discussed often by the people in the subreddits many time over many year what you think of a a novel idea or discussion you re just now stumbling on ha been already been welltrodden but take the polar opposite not just of your view but of your basic and fundamental assumption someone who tell you straight up that people do not own their own labor maybe the first time you d hash it out really delve into the philosophy and implication the second time you run into someone like that you might do a summary of your view eventually it s just oh good god i ve had this conversation dozen of time and it always go the same way someone should just read prior discussion and explanation
AH you re really dense what he could have accomplished would have prevented the fall event long ago can affect the present and you wo nt even know
NONE i did nt come to change your view i came a someone that fully agrees if you do nt serve how can you make decision that affect people s life
AH there are argument that they will consider beneath a serious response i m sorry if your smugness get in the way do you offer a full thoughtful rebuttal to everyone who tell you to move to somalia like i said elsewhere in this thread somolia is not close to anything i advocate for so why on earth would i move there any time the somolia argument is brought up i instantly know i m dealing with someone who refuse to learn the difference between a voluntary society and a third world country ravaged by warlord and foreign policy of other country if you want a thoughtful response to an argument make sure you re not comparing antarctica to the bahamas otherwise take your circlejerk rpolitics argument elsewhere you have contributed absolutely nothing to this thread but ad hominem attack and the typical liberalconservative talking point and almost everyone in here know it
NONE race religion and creed do not come into the fostering and adoption decision process so why would they come into this process there is evidence that there is http wwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtm this is nt meant to be a way to weed out a people just a way to avoid child abuse or neglect you do nt get point for good intention if a policy creates a bad outcome it s a bad policy especially when people can tell you beforehand that the outcome is going to be different than the stated intent edit we need to ignore the morality of it a even i agree it d be hugely immoral i m just convinced it could work in theory alone you re walking back the claim in your original post already people should earn the right to have child and currently i feel that the pro far outweigh the con if you re conceding that it s immoral and that alone is enough to discourage the action then we should nt follow this course of action period
AH cool so you have no argument or idea to dispute with the truth of my message you say lifting up savage is good this is not a true statement them eating is not a good thing them starving to death is the good thing would be them starving to death and allowing nature to cure their overpopulation you made no argument though you made some emotional appeal muh food muh everyone get iphones the state of the planet is better than them living
NONE the environment is an existential concern for all of u prioritizing that behind disadvantaged people s pain is essentially saying that it s better if we re all dead than for the world to be unfair then there s the issue that disadvantage is nt binary and some would be impossible to operationalize into policy if sleeping with a guy doe nt prove you re gay what would be acceptable proof and do you really want a government ruling on who is and is nt ugly
AH i believe you misinterpreted the first part it generally here i used a an example because it would universally make you a criminal it seems you intentionally misinterpreted that but whatever we are talking about if you dont know who is the onus on to find out about the other person is it the person who ha a subjective nonuniversal opinion or is it the one who doe nt you are just coming off a angry and irrational now please calm yourself your anger issue are preventing you from thinking clearly perhaps you need help
NONE i ’ m glad someone else share this view the phrase is a meaningless platitude it ’ s the equivalent of saying “ aww are you ok ” when someone hurt themselves you can never not be yourself if you fake something or lie about something that ’ s still who you are you ’ re the kind of person who would go to those length in certain situation better advice is “ be the best version of yourself that you want others to see ” if you think a situation call for confidence be confident if you think a situation call for humour be humorous
AH hahaha yeah because all wiki page are just joking right and i m sure the dozen and dozen of scholarly paper written by professional historian supporting the fact in those wiki are all just made by retard yknow cmv is nt for troll it s for people who can actually debate with evidence if you ca nt do that stay off this sub if you re so blinded by your ideology you re incapable of rational discourse you should also stay off this sub if when you re confronted with viewpoint that challenge your own your best response is childish ad hom attack and emojis you should also stay off this sub you neatly fit all three category so do u all a favor and stay the fuck off this sub what a waste of time
NONE i think the important difference here is between constantly thinking skeptically and constantly playing devil s advocate while it is always important to be able to question what you hear and you own belief for example by putting yourself in the mindset of the opposing view a you say you should nt automatically express these contrary and skeptical opinion not only because it may make you look like a contrarian as or a falseintellectual with no opinion of his own this of course depends on context but from my own experience people think that more than they say but because it may prevent you from engaging with valid and interesting opinion and view just because you want to experiment with opposing them so i d say keep up what you doing but keep in internal at least until you ve evaluated how worthy of opposition or skepticism an opinion is
AH and i m pointing out that there are so many difference between uk and u that it s exceptionally stupid to use them a comparison point try again
NONE i agree it would be different if his past wa somehow relevant to the current situation with united but it is nt they re just trying to smear him because of their fuck up

NONE if not reddit it d just be something else long work hour seem more to blame for people s interest in slacking off than the existence of reddit worker in general are nt productive for the entire work day and i m betting most of them do nt go on reddit so reddit is not a problem it s just an outlet for people experiencing a different problem too many work hour not enough of an attention down etc
AH i m not going to watch anything you post heh i rest my case folk if you do nt want to have a conversation with me the normal nontrolly thing to do would be to stop responding not sort of keep a conversation going but exclusively a a medium to engage in bratty harassment
NONE no need to change your view you re correct to be offended that someone want to try look like something they admire is pathetic just because other people have misused something in the past doe not mean people should apply that same mind set for every single person that doe it
AH your reading comprehension is truly out of this world not only did you misunderstand the claim that the study wa making you failed to find the link to their source that wa in the same sentence but do nt worry i got you fam http reportsweforumorgglobalgendergapreportreporthighlights
NONE so with that argument out of the way where is your definition coming from so far all the definition you ve sourced have nothing to do with fruit i would also note that it is generally accepted practice to give delta for partial view change not sure if this constitutes one in your opinion
AH you held your newborn down no i did nt cut the most sensitive part of their body without any pain killer unless you count the dose of anesthetic he got one of the first experience they ever felt pretty clearly did nt feel it he nearly fell asleep during the procedure actually the only time he got pissed off is when he choked on some spit which he d already done like time that day your opinion is duly noted and immediately disregarded since i have no idea who you are and do nt particularly care what you think next time i have to make a decision regarding the wellbeing of my family i ll make sure to not care what you think then either
NONE a a guy who ha had testicular torsion which is commonly referred to a roughly equivalent to birthing i take a little offense to this why i did nt downplay your suffering or compare the two you could take offense if i downplayed your suffering the way i took offense that you downplayed the suffering of pregnancy and childbirth yes which is why in the body of my cmv post i specified the demanding of a gift not the entire idea of them all that seemed a little much to put into the title well you did nt you brought it up but did nt specify that your entire cmv is only about demanding push present but if you say that s what it is now fine
AH it s called atrocity tourism you come to gawk at all the stupid
NONE this is the kind of post that even the subhumans look at in disgust
AH there is a difference between selfishness and wanting to keep what you have earned if i work for a year and the government take a third of it to give to lazy bum who wo nt work because they do nt want to they are the truly selfish one they want money for nothing if that is nt lacking consideration for others concerned chiefly with one s own personal profit or pleasure it is inconsiderate and concerned chiefly with one s own pleasure to take money from those who have earned it a for the ignorant part there are ignorant people on both side i for one have seen much more ignorant liberal ie homeless people who are clueless and blindly follow the democratic party regardless you obviously are the ignorant one here and i do nt know why i bothered typing this response because liberal are unwilling to debate and are brainwashed into their viewpoint to the point where they can not see past their own prejudice
NONE i do nt think the right would describe themselves a selfish i m not saying they are not selfish but they certainly do nt all have selfish intent some right people would see some on the left a selfish particularly the thought that people want to come after what they perceive they have worked hard to get they see the sense of entitlement to other people s money a selfish i m not right leaning myself but i imagine the right see thing like tax and expensive publicly funded social program a what get in the way of people having more money and doing better for themselves setting condition to create more job and allowing people to work for their money in their goal i do nt think in general the right want to see the world burn and screw everyone else they just have a different philosophy based on what ha worked for them and their family there are selfish people right across the political spectrum and generous one too painting one side a the bad guy is an easy trap to fall in to
AH no in reality this is merely an attempt to drum up a moral outrage on this subreddit by someone with a username that highly suggests an inherent bias by pointing out someone who is odd and using them to suggest lgbtq people are pedophile the target of this concern is one person who op is so fixated on that he ha apparently taken the time to research their sexual history we do nt have similar thread that focus on other individual who are odd why this one if this thread is not foundationally dishonest it is stupid and op need to go outside
NONE the value and importance placed on being exceptionally good at math is mostly because it can while in many case social skill can not singlehandedly make someone into a successful person for life i do nt want to dispute your claim in fact i probably agree with it but it is a wholly useless claim if there is i m unaware is there any way to quantitatively measure someone s social intelligence if there s not that is certainly part of the reason why it s not valued nearly a much about a skill that can be measured like math edit placed
AH how are they going to search your hard drive or car unless they fucking take it physically smarta

NONE you had a rough life i do nt wish that on anyone but at the end of the day you do nt look like it we honestly live in a world were we judge people like do nt judge a book by the cover my life sucked too i hate my parent and wa raised by my grandma i have no financial support from anyone i know a lot of people who have the option of to go back home and not pay bill i do nt it s mostly stereotype people may look at me and think i m a bitch but i m just bad at socializing your white skin is a stereotype and people believe it instantly white woman are seen a pure and innocent and black woman are seen a ignorant and loud it s the way it is hell i got a name that sound black but it s actually native american and a national park but dammit people judge it so quickly nothing bother me more when an old white person say that s interesting really that s not a complement
AH im not engaging in this nonsense youre just being a condescending asshole at this point so im not going to reply to you any further your follow up question are framed to intentionally misunderstand my entire point so i dont have to prove anything to you all you have to do is look at all the liberal art major stuck in the service industry why dont you ask them why they couldnt just put their oceanography class on their resume lmao a more robust major with more class with le opportunity for elective let the student graduate from college with the best understanding of their major a possible
NONE what exactly is the point of having an internal measure of how well you are doing i can understand that getting by ha been through seeking the approval of others but the best lesson you can learn is to have an internal compass it feel like it should nt be necessary to the point where why should i have to know so much non course related detailsinformation just for a project again in sensing you re not committed to learning and are just trying to blame the teacher for your grade look learn to ask question i d help but you d probably not commit yourself and blame something else

NONE thank you i did nt mean to be snotty with my first sentence wa trying to get across that the reason you cited in your comment in some form are reasonably widely held in this country and that politician base their decision on the matter off of those reason leading in part to the normal untouchability of the subject it s the same sort of feedback that make social security untouchable on a smaller scale if i wa helpful in changing your view would you mind deltaing me i m pretty new to this subreddit and it d be nice to see one in my flair

AH i can see from your comment that you are one of those people who get upset and angry from news like this that money mean a lot to those executive i wa just pointing out that those low wage worker are nt going to get rich by forcing those executive to give up their wealth people who are upset are just jealous or do nt know the truth those who have work to earn their money like ceo s yes the have to work hard to run the company even though they get a nice office air conditioning and lot of money know that if you do nt inherit wealth or win the lottery you can only get rich if you have a valuable skill and proper motivation
NONE i dont understand why you are picking on athlete at least they legitimately do something that requires skill im more shocked that a a society we allow any businessman to make billion of dollar i mean it might be obscene that lebron james make million a year but it is not nearly a obscene a the fact that any of the fortune people make billion a year these richest people do nt do shit they basically just let their money make money so they are stealing from society on the basis of their having capital to invest i think you need to chill about athlete and focus on the real people who are disgusting
AH because of this there s plenty reason to believe that by the time technology get to a point where significant improvement can be made to gameplay and graphic in the series to create fallout it may not make financial sense to make it and we very well could never see it year and a new console generation later we have seen the announcement trailer for fallout and it is slated for release this very year you were completely wrong about this and have no idea what you are talking about
NONE if someone go onto imdb to see how good a film is knowing how good a film wa to people year ago is nt going to help much what is useful to them and indeed would have been useful to you before you watched those film is how much you in the context of modern society will enjoy those film if a film ha aged badly this would be reflected in the rating perhaps what would help would be two rating one that wa given at the time and one that can be constantly updated
AH understanding what other consider important and newsworthy is a important a deciding for yourself what s important if you watched the news regularly you would learn that cnn felt it wa important to spend month continually repeating that mh is probably at the bottom of the indian ocean and nothing else important happened during that time you would learn that all the expert on tv feel that ebola and isi are nt serious threat unless you want to be really terrified of them you would learn that a football player punching his girlfriend in the face requires public address from the us government understanding what others find important and how they decided to tell the story of those important event is critical to understanding the social world around you fuck you gamergate is the biggest scandal we will experience in our lifetime you re just a sexist hitler
NONE where is the point at which you stop trying and pack your bag if you truly care a much a i think you do that point doe nt exist how many people throughout history were the catalyst for change but either did nt know it or did nt live long enough to see the change what it come down to is that the more people like you that are in the country the better off everyone is even the people that disagree with you even if you can open just one person s mind that s another one out there that now want to get involved and change thing another thing you should realize is that you live in probably one of the most politically active time in this nation s history with the proliferation of social medium cause catch fire very quickly that would have never gained ground year ago basically this is the perfect time to be working for a change because of how many option you have for getting your message out there
AH saying that the majority of a group doe not commit to action is not saying that said majority support anything either you completely lack reading comprehension skill or you re trying to set an impossible bar i m not sure which let keep this very simple to avoid confusion let start with this part of your incoherent rant yes some of them are speaking against it many of them are opposed to it but the problem is that most are doing nothing and that is what is scaring people they are afraid of the good people in the middle that make up the majority will do nothing it seems you re trying to say one of two thing here either that the majority of muslim do nt actually condemn terrorism or that even though the majority of muslim do condemn terrorism since the majority of muslim are nt picking up rifle to go fight isi they are turning a blind eye to terrorism if you are trying to make the first point in that the majority of muslim do nt actually condemn terrorism then you are wrong a shown by the pew poll i linked if you re trying to make the second point in that because the majority of muslim are nt actively picking up weapon to fight isi they are turning a blind eye to them you are setting an impossible bar by that standard there is nt a single demographic anywhere who is nt turning a blind eye to isi the united state who ha been conducting drone strike on isi target is doing nothing because the majority of american are nt operating the drone
NONE what you re describing is exactly the problem we face today instead of trying to convince you to change your view you should convince yourself to expand your view being unpleasant is an emotional reaction to someone else s view it doe zero to change that person s view and ultimately impairs your side s ability to actually understand the view in the first place look at the border wall democrat voted for a border wall in in wanting a border wall mean you re an immigrant hating xenophobe did trump say some nasty shit about mexican sure doe that mean everyone who agrees with the need for border security is a bigot no so why is that the common view among liberal today the problem is a others have pointed out is using that line of thought is more likely to get of people outraged and motivated but that s a good thing you say people should be involved sure people should be involved but they should also understand what they are involved in not blindly follow the stereotype that republican are evil because they want to split up family and send child back to live among the drug cartel doe anyone with any sense think that s the actual reasoning that somehow the entire middle of the country hate hispanic and want them to die spreading shit like that just make the divide bigger and make it more and more difficult for government to compromise and work on the thing actually important to the people
AH that is fucking retarded and i covered all of that and why s it s wrong if you ca nt see that you re a piece of shit i d rather have a fucked up weirdo in society that an antisocial piece of shit who harm others

AH why ca nt you just fucking talk about the topic you decided to comment on if you read my response you d see i am why are you so hung up on formality and not even a bit on the topic this is arrogant projection still i wa nt false but you obviously have no intention on getting on with the real argument see i ca nt work with this a person who can declare something to be true that they know to be false then they insist it wa nt false such a person is worthless you know you lied i know it anyone following this know it but your arrogance wo nt let you admit it
NONE it called respect and common sense if were talking about let say some family stuff i would expect you understand what you should and shouldnt tell others it a bit of a social contract think of it this way will it embarrass them why do i have the right to tell someone should nt it come from them if it something sensitive i guess i dont think of friend a newspaper that i have to state it off the record if you were to tell me you had an abortion after we had an emotional talk it might be fucked up to post on facebook omg she had an abortion what do you guy think
AH i ll deal with the graph first i do nt see any bar labelled long term social change which is what both of u agree is a good way to limit danger that s not the point the fact is a person defending themselves with a gun limit injury to themselves far more than any other defense method limiting the chance of that thing happening to that person at all is for a separate debate you ca nt just discount them to fit your weak argument i ll reiterate that the level of gun control i think we should eventually reach is not the level i think is appropriate now i do nt care what matter is people carrying gun save life secondly read a book is not an argument i m giving you detailed explanation of why i think what i do which you term twisting fact you re simply stating you re disagreement in most places no you have no idea what a right actually is so your opinion on the matter hold zero authority okay granted by who or what the fact that you are human the fact that i do nt need to tell you to want to live the fact that i do nt need to tell you to protect and value your property the fact that i do nt need to tell you to speak whats on your mind the fact that being human make you feel compelled by all of those thing that s where right come from just about everyone agrees to feeling that compulsion only a very small minority feel compulsiveness to kill and that is not recognized a a human behavior but an inhuman one that is why murder is not a right you are stonecold retarded if you think murder is a right
NONE sorry for taking so long to reply first off i disagree with your definition of morality i would limit it only to life which can experience utility if the life doe nt care if it is hurt than it is not being hurt this mean that it is moral to cut down a tree excluding the affect on being other than the tree or kill bacteria i think this is the same idea you were going for so wo nt spend a lot of time on it next i do nt understand how you go from i am only myself not all life to i only have to care about myself if we can agree that utility is the mist important thing than why do nt we want to maximize it a much a possible you say if helping other people also help you and only if it help you will you do it i agree that is every person s imperative because everyone want to maximize their personal happiness however i disagree that it is the moral thing to do i say that doing the action that maximizes utility for all being is the moral action and understand that is a different action than what people will actually do one thing which i do nt understand is what moral imperative is a i understand it it mean the action one is compelled to do based on what is right but the context you put it in make it sound like moral responsibility what is the difference if it is responsibility i have a reply for that but i do nt want to make an unnecessary argument could you explain what that phrase mean
AH you are incapable of a rational discussion
NONE you re completely wrong in supposing that
AH uhh no earlier than that in the early th century there were hired goon who beat up worker exercising their right to assemble and strike a a consumer i get cheaper and better car now but i ll bet you bitch about tax and too stupid to make the connection there is no reason that a third party the union should be able to block a contract between an employer and employee and it would nt be necessary if stupid white men were nt so stupid to work against their own best interest think for yourself for once in your life
NONE make voting a national holiday a an aside i ve never understood that argument it sound good on it face but many of the people who need the day off to go vote are the same people that we need working in order to keep society functioning we still need people manning the infrastructure every single day moreover it s not like people would get paid for this holiday most minimum wage worker do nt get paid holiday anyway for many it not that they cant take the time off but the fact that they need the paycheck more than they need to vote
AH this is hilarious and a little sad how about i quote the entire comment here for your reading pleasure born and raised in the deep south idk where you re getting that information from but it s far from the truth this wa in response to you saying it s a common occurrence in the deep south for entire town to shun people for not being religious i responded that that is far from the truth which it is a i have shown assuming worst case that the deep south is time worse than the rest of the country you get percent of percent of people affected in the deep south that is in no way common it would be enough people to fill up one mid sized town for the entire deep south not multiple town constantly shunning and expelling nonreligious people a you claimed you then attempted to prove that point by showing that there are a few hundred thousand homeless lgtb teen which you made the logical leap of assuming wa caused by christian conservative even with that absurd leap you get that percent of percent of the population is affected that is statistically insignificant now i m sure you ll reply to this but you said this thing you actually did nt say so you re a liar and i eagerly await it
NONE this is what i call the this time it s different fallacy which to my knowledge is nt a real fallacy but it s a common way of thinking which i think can be dangerous andor lead to skewed expectation around the turn of the th century no one would have believed that ww and would be possible or the sheer scale of loss of life combined between those war approximately of the population of the entire planet wa killed think about that for a second that would be equivalent to the entire u population today i know it seems insane that something like that could ever happen but it happened le than year ago and ha happened throughout history see here for more http enwikipediaorgwikilistofwarsbydeathtoll while war today would look different than war in the past due to technological advance super power have been warring with each other for essentially the entire recorded history of the world a thing are today we are probably safe but all it take is for a couple of wildcard crazy dictator to throw off the balance of power and start a conflict essentially the argument boil down to knowing history people have said time and time again oh that could never happen and yet it always ha the situation is not so vastly different now that you can rule that out at all
AH this is the stupidest think i ve read all day do you know anything about redistribution of wealth red terror etc
NONE instead of downvoting this thread and being a coward it would help if some of you actually explained why you dont like this idea
AH your actually an idiot haha
NONE yeah man you re pretty right ∆
AH no my point is that the person with the experience should be the one responsible for safety of all involved that doe nt even make sense no amount of training will help you against someone who is resisting if you are nt using force do you want officer to use jedi mind trick to force them to cooperate so according to you police officer have no trainingexperience on how to safely deal with people resisting arrest do nt be an idiot i never said that it s not easy to deal with someone safely who is resisting if someone is resisting then either the arresting officer will be put at risk or the person being arrested will put be put at risk in that case it make more sense to put the person who is resisting at risk
NONE i love the fact that police officer are required to wear body camera think about it if we have these on officer we can have more evidence about crime whether that be against the cop or a criminal we can prove easier if someone resisted arrest or if there wa disorderly conduct also we can prove if the officer and used aggressive force without reason or wa misbehaving in any other form we can use these camera to our advantage against crime with the common citizen and the police people who against this may argue that it invasion of privacy but they re working almost all other institution track pretty much everything you do while working why doe nt that apply to cop it a good idea and we should implement more
AH time after time when preventive class such a self defense against rape are taught rape case go down given this reality there ha to be a divide in your logic and the reality of the situation you are not considering here given that we have study such a this http wwwnejmorgdoifullnejmsa and large case such a this http wwwmedicaldailycomteachinggirlsselfdefenseradicallyreducesrapekenya to consider not teaching self relient defense is ludicrous and show a want to blame rather than actually prevent mace is a metaphor for any step able to be taken it doe nt just have to be mace or mace at all do nt be a dick about this you need to show how teaching self relience harm the process of support so much that more rape occur due to an individual not being brought to justice caused by teaching self relient defense than were prevented by teaching self relience until you can only teaching some men you ca nt reach all remember not to rape is approaching half the problem
NONE while i agree that we should only have healthy child who will be able to have good life at least a good a we can predict them to be eugenics http enwikipediaorgwikieugenics is a topic that s best avoided i know your prompt doe nt directly focus on that but it s close enough and your reasoning doe kind of flow into it eugenics is bad because while it make a lot of sense on paper in reality it lead to all sort of abuse if you subscribe to that view the one about the good life then of course we should be able to choose which child we have and when after all that s why we use birth control and vaccinate child there is no logical point to giving birth to someone who wo nt even get to live enough to mature a for terminating incurable fetus the discussion becomes about the value of a life i personally do not think life ha an intrinsic value and whether we live or die is quite irrelevant in the grand scheme of thing just like any other animal
AH then explain how it would be done this should be good you already admitted that the nazi did so why should i have to explain a point you already admitted you were wrong on then why did you advocate for the detainment and deportation of illegal immigrant in your initial comment you lost an argument and are now fabricating thing i said if i advocated for the detainment and deportation of illegal immigrant then quote me i only showed what a weak and incorrect argument you made not anything else you must be seriously fucking retarded to not be able to tell the difference jesus christ i have never seen someone so oblivious when i asked about checking everyones id before allowing them on public road you said that this happens all the time with bus pass toll road bridge etc you re wrong you said it impossible you think that it possible for airport to do so but not public road you re wrong because you are too stupid to think outside of your gated community doe not change reality then what s your point most unconvincing upvoted post ever apparently drooling retard like you are unable to read either
NONE why would you assume to speak for me you obviously got rubbed the wrong way by the op s post but i surely did nt i m a man who wa sexually assaulted so you d think i d have some extra sensitivity to this issue eh his first statement i wish because it would change how people unfairly scrutinize sexual assault victim there s no demanding there he proposes an if thisthen that scenario he list what he think would be the benefit of this at no point doe he suggest that people have to or should that is your bias that you projected and why are you so sensitive to this yourself were you assaulted if so you have my deepest condolence and i would hope that you d help the cause by speaking about it if not stop being such an as and by the way you re being extremely disingenuous in regard to tjk s comment you are insulting and belittling and then pretend that it s just him you are not nearly a intelligent or subtle a you like to think you are let me know if you need a recap fella intelligent eh
AH stick your finger in your ear keep retreating to stupider and stupider assumption about people being trained to call good behavior nonconsensual penetration whatever you need to be convinced that your worldview a it stand now is flawless and unquestionably correct surely you re right the problem with reported rape is the woman reporting it
NONE well you asked why people do it that s the reason whether or not your view change is up to you also your definition of worse is an opinion that not everyone would agree with a well plus we agreed that backing in is safer whether or not you re accepting the fact that you re insanely stubborn is not my problem it yours
AH well let me do my part then to get you banned from this sub have a good day
NONE definitely unprofessional if this were a ta working for me i d call them out on it
AH doe that clear it up first off go fuck yourself secondly the is no such thing a a language being better off language are they are defined and shaped by usage the responds to need and to a degree whimsy there are no good language there are no bad language there are only language that continue to be used and those that do nt so in that sense all of this is completely pointless thirdly whether or not we accept literally in it s hyperbolic usage is irrelevant it s been around for about a century and is nt likely to go anywhere anytime soon lastly no it doe nt clear anything up cause ai nt nothing foggy there are no realistic circumstance in which a native speaker would honestly become confused by these dual meaning the context and sentence structure for each usage is vastly different have you ever been confused by this apparently vexing but completely non existent ambiguity i m guessing not since you seem capable of stringing at least a few word together to form a coherent thought a evidenced by the thousand and thousand and thousand of other word that hold dual meaning there is literally no problem to consider it is well within the ability of any given individual to discern which usage is being used
NONE emojis are a natural evolution of our written language evolution mean change over time doe nt mean it s good we have essentially added heiroglyphics that provide nuance to short written message i believe they are first step to a universally understandable language or we have replaced the specific word with nuanced hieroglyph i mean there is a reason why symbol are the most primitive form of language i want to challenge the widely held view that emojis are childish and unprofessional well they are by definition that s not to be taken a they are bad and should be eliminated it just mean that you do nt find emoji s in any professional paper or article and the largest demographic that us them are child another dimension of written language is a necessity for the future of efficient communication how many office dispute could have been avoided if someone had nt misinterpreted the tone of an email 🙄 i mean how many office spat could be avoided if people just explained it properly
AH example about the struggle of men would not do anything towards advancing the treatment of woman ha caught you and them according to you feminism is about advancing the struggle of woman not about equality at all like the academic try to spin it ok so go to hell with your sexism
NONE but it s not about homophobe or straight people it s explicitly not about what others think of them that s the whole point of gay pride to be themselves in an unrestricted manner it seems like you find this hard to believe but gay pride ha nothing to do with the gay community trying to win you over
AH keep up the ad hominem and false sense of superiority it ll get you far in life

AH that is called putting word in someone s mouth probably the hugest problem in modern political discussion everyone is so unable to discus they are constantly on the prowl for an argument or disagreement people can abuse er visit for being dehydrated or having a cough thing like that btw i actually support universal healthcare and i wa nt opposing it by differentiating disaster recovery from universal healthcare these thing come from understanding logic what an as
NONE i am not much good at this change my view thing because it seems i agree too often with the posted idea so i will add two point to this conversation first it benefit those in control of our society that we are afraid because scared people are easily manipulated and it is easier to sell product to scared people secondly by far the biggest killer in america is obesity related disease almost everything else including gun violence come a distant second

NONE social preening happened before the internet it wa just not a widespread meaning that it happened in smaller circle and only those circle knew about it the learning happened in school and library by nerd before it wa cool to be one the only difference here is that the preening is accessible by people who were nt at the event far easily than in the past economic looking at world statistic this is simply false medicine is more widespread than ever birth defect are lower than evere the world population is better than it ever ha been the extreme case you are talking about are simply being exposed like never before this may be why you think it s bad all over but that is only because bad news sell and attracts click better than good news political voicing yourself against what is common ha always had backlash if i go outside and scream against liberalcommunistsocialist ideal people around me will just nod in agreement or join in however if i travel mile west of where i live i ll be labeled a bigot and close minded probably end up in a fight not everyone on every side is open minded this is nothing new if it wa we would nt have had world war environmental all of the disorder and diagnosis you are talking about are happening because we know more and medical science is improving this point alone contradicts your main topic or viewpoint if we were getting dumber we would just have dumb baby and not know why i think the point you were trying to make with the last paragraph wa that change is nt happening to fix the root cause but you are talking about making a steam locomotive do a at mph with a full set of car it s not fast and the people riding those car to get where they thought they needed to be are going to scream at you to not turn it around since they will have all this wasted timeeffort sunken cost fallacy hope this help a little
AH i did nt merely cry intersectionality and frankly given your track record of understanding what i m saying and your inability to make actual counter argument i ve come to the conclusion that this conversation ca nt be productive in the future do nt wear your contempt on your sleeve
NONE i do nt entirely disagree with you which is why i kept my original post to just explaining why i m afraid and in the next reply why i also encourage other woman to be wary but i do nt disagree at all that men should also be aware of their surroundings i would nt want to change that view

AH of course your main point still stand i never denied it nor did i attempt to but the fact remains that there is no historical evidence for hebrew in egypt how the myth started i m not going to guess it s not a doltish claim that some random redditor is making it s historical consensus it s not even hard to find jewish people that can admit this truth you do nt have to believe in a literal account of historical myth in order to fit into your culture the vast majority of christian do nt literally believe the world wa created in day and i suspect the same is true of jew the historical figure of jesus who wa likely a real person whether you believe in the divine miracle etc that christian claim he performed or not wa almost certainly not born on th december indeed he wa likely born in summer or early spring and yet that is when christian celebrate christmas it doe nt change the significance of their holiday that the reason behind it is factually incorrect the same is true of passover it s a good holiday with a good message behind it even if the reason that it is celebrated are historically inaccurate personally i choose to believe the historian and archeologist who are trained in this kind of thing and know what they re doing rather than cultural tradition have a read of this http enwikipediaorgwikihistoryofthejewsinegypt genesisandexodus or this one from a jewish writer on what appears to be a jewish website http wwwhaaretzcomjewishworldthejewishthinkerwerejewseverreallyslavesinegyptorispassoveramyth and one more from a rabbi with a phd in ancient semitic language and whose academic field is bible and cognate study http wwwreformjudaismorgwerejewsslavesegypt
NONE i do nt completely disagree with you but i think religion at least promotes some form of ethical change take all the different kind of christianity we have today protestantism catholicism orthodox and tell me that they all sport exactly the same unchanged moral that s right they do nt over hundred of year many different church and group have interpreted religion in their own way and then turned that into some form of moral structure although it may not have always been for the better it wa change why did some saxon tribe go from ceremonial war dance to reciting the lord prayer before battle because religion changed how they behaved and then it continued to change them after that take john ball a a specific example of how religion can promote moral growth he lived in a time at which feudalism wa still around where the king wa supposedly chosen by divine right and a large quantity of the population were essentially slave what did he do to fight these injustice he called upon the bible of course stating that no man had the right to elevate him self where in the eye of god we were all created equal see frossiarts chronicle or here http enwikipediaorgwikijohnball priest for more info ball wa not the only one who sought to change ethic through religion though look at wycliffe the digger or anyone who challenged their contemporary system in the name of their god s also the thing about getting stuck in religious text is a bit silly churchesgroups have always interpreted holy book in their own way which is why we have so many different sect of each religion lastly i agree that basing your moral on year old book is a bit odd but at the same time you can find some pretty compassionate teaching in various religious scripture a lot of the bible for example preaches concept which are very similar to socialism a theory that continues to be relevant today

NONE i mean i completely agree with your point and i share your sentiment i would be pretty upset to find out my new girlfriend wa a biological male the biggest reason being that i want to have kid kid that came from myself and my female partner that is one thing that is not only important but absolutely vital in life to me controversial thought based on personalsecondhand experience there are people who happen to be transsexual who basically do this kind of thing a a way to make a point i know of people who have engaged in physical intimacy with trans interest and discovered this information during or after and the resulting situation became an episode of preaching and complaining about social intolerance in a manner that seemed premeditated a if these particular trans folk were trying to create situation like this just so that they could preach at somebody that i find to be not only completely obnoxious but unfair and uncalled for if you re interested in somebody be interested good for you i m happy for you but do not use the bedroom a a podium do not set someone up and trap them so that you can unload your agenda all over them i have a good degree of tolerance for social difference and lifestyle choice but not when you go out of your way to shove it down my throat

NONE well the atom are identical but decay seemingly at random there is no apparent reason for this being so a far a i m aware so it is truly random obviously this doe nt allow for free will in any way and it is true that they decay within a fixed range which we know but determinism is nt necessarily true at every level of physic why should a thought being predetermined make it any le unique or important uniqueness and importance are entirely independent of being freely generated whatever that could mean
AH a far a i can tell that is exactly the context we have here an atheist know for a fact hat they are nt going to do a google search one day and turn up evidence of a god or god because by definition they exist outside of the realm of nature and can neither be proven nor disproved by mean of observation and experiment you on the other hand do nt google because you have no interest and then make judgement about claim based on your lack of interest in researching them further the claim made by op and which are the subject of this downthread can absolutely be looked up there s plenty of literature on them i promise my discipline pump out a disproportionate amount of it the rest of your post is nt worth addressing do better
NONE it is a way to get personalized on the spot information especially a i ve said that the person in question is more than likely an expert on the subject at hand actually this is not so obvious just because someone feels something is offensive doe not mean they can explain why and how let alone teach someone how to avoid it offensiveness is a nebulous and subjective thing there is also something to be said about backing up claim with evidence when applicable again in majority of case there is no hard evidence because offensiveness is subjective cultural and depends on the emotion of the people involved so in the end the offended person can just kindasorta impart on the offender that what they didsaid made them and other people feel bad but the exact specific and rule are actually much more flimsy when explained than when felt
AH reread the comment you replied to and edit the one i m replying to before you look like a fool

AH you are a pussy i say this not a a childish insult but to make a point sometimes men need to men fighting is part of human nature it is primal there is a reason everyone come running when someone yell fight outlawing combat sport would be trying to deny this core element of human nature a consensual fight with rule a ref and doctor standing by is a relatively safe outlet for this primal urge
NONE i argue that by banding in group people against the idea of gay marriage have an easier target to shut down i feel this is one of your primary argument and it is one i simply do nt understand it is far easier to shut down a single person a compared to a group a single person can be marked a crazy or beat into silence or just ignored a group mean something though it s why pac exist rather than individual lobbyist
AH i m just joining it good and recognize that you re a white privilege male and shut the fuck up about thing you nothing about or have experienced again you re misunderstanding my purpose here what is your purpose then other than injecting yourself into a topic and movement that doe nt want or need you i want to build a just society so that who the majority is doe nt matter it ll never happen it s the competitive nature of our society and economy someone and some group will always be the dominant no different than sport so i thank you for trying to help u minority rise and become equal but please know this we do nt and will not owe you shit
NONE from one of your previous submission i just ca nt do a job where i feel like i m in a stupid cubicle doing nothing important from another submission do you think one can be happy without hard work so you do nt want to work in a cubicle and you do nt want to work hard you need to sit down and consider what you do want to do not everyone ha the same standard for a worthwhile pursuit and by gauging your success by other s standard you re always going to be unhappy you need to figure out what it is you want and create success by your own standard sometimes that mean casting aside what others think is worthwhile but sometimes that mean finding meaning in thing you do nt currently value

AH it s not the carrier s duty to give me any of that they choose to give me these service for free and it s my choice to take it or leave it when you consider that the five biggest isps in the country provide service to million people and they all provide cable tv is it really that difficult to imagine the kind of fuckery they are going to deliver to customer regarding competing company like netflix or hulu you d have to have the brain of a potato to be unable to figure out how net neutrality wouldnt be beneficial to the vast majority of customer
NONE one could argue it s a scummy consumer practice to apply for a free trial without any intention of purchasing the product them cutting off service make a lot of sense it only upset people who were trying to cheat them out of their service if you cut off payment you are indicating that you do not enjoy the service enough to pay for it the company can take this and say well they do nt want the service so we will stop providing it a questioning individual would probably wait until late into the trial to cut off payment rather than cutting it off partway through

AH that s such a stupid and simplistic worldview if you think the race are equal then black people should be able to get into college on their own merit and not have to rely on affirmative action to get in why should you require asian to have to work twice a hard to achieve something if you think everyone is equal asian had it rough in the past too there wa even legislation signed to prevent them from becoming citizen maybe they are nt hiring black because other candidate are more qualified hiring based off of merit doe nt make them racist hiring of black just to satisfy a quota though is illegal giving another race an advantage just due to their race is racism you re being stupid by just throwing around claim of racism
NONE many of your point seem to fit more with the idea that the standard should be changed updated to fit both sex an example being that woman are allowed to keep longer hair and are nt asked to shave their face okay that sound like a perfect reason to loosen the regulation on men not ban woman woman can join the civilian sector equivalent again this is not a valid reason to exclude anybody just because i can go get a private job doe nt mean i should be fired from my government job pregnancy pull woman away from duty this is your most valid argument i think there is something to say about this and i do nt think it is a viable option to make the rule equal to allow men in the military leave to take care of their newborn
AH for fuck sake you know what i m trying to say stop being willfully obtuse the fucking god damned act of fucking god damned native fucking speaker talking in their native fucking language is shit cocking different then fuck learning a god damn new language if you are discussing the efficacy of a language ability to communicate information based on criterion within that language like syntax phoneme bit rate etc etc then you are discussing fluent speaker communicating in that language the circumstance of an individual trying to achieve fluency in said language is irrelevant to the discussion of that language ability to communicate information within itself none of this would even be an issue if you had nt attempted to deflect the conversation away fro your original line of argument in which you were clearly wrong and shoe horn in the idea that you suddenly wanted to make it easier to learn english
NONE i want to comment specifically on the idea that an idiom can be used incorrectly the purpose of language is effective communication if a person express an idea and the people listening to that person understand it then by what metric can we say that the language used wa incorrect if a friend were to ask me how difficult it is to learn a certain skill and i told her that there s a steep learning curve she would understand what i mean that it s difficult to begin to learn if i said there wa a shallow learning curve she would likely either assume the opposite or simply be more confused my basic point here is this the fact that language change over time doe nt necessarily make newer linguistic construction incorrect many word and phrase we now use daily and consider to be perfect english are corrupted or bastardized form of older word or phrase the only reason that these are considered more correct is the perception of their age
AH wow it s rare to see such a display of willful idiocy thanks for that

NONE my father and i had this conversation once i m not good with word so i ll post the excerpt from the book i used a my main point it s from the hogfather by terry pratchett s the capifalized letter are by the character death who is conversing with his granddaughter about the tooth fairy the purpose of belief and how it applies to humanity all right said susan i m not stupid you re saying human need fantasy to make life bearable really a if it wa some kind of pink pill no human need fantasy to be human to be the place where the falling angel meet the rising ape tooth fairy hogfathers little— yes a practice you have to start out learning to believe the little lie so we can believe the big one yes justice mercy duty that sort of thing they re not the same at all you think so then take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice one molecule of mercy and yet—death waved a hand and yet you act a if there is some ideal order in the world a if there is some some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged yes but people have got to believe that or what s the point— my point exactly terry pratchett

AH what you re saying is absolutely ridiculous let me try to break this down for you you are claiming that every pet which is left home alone during the work day is suffering a silent and completely invisible form of ptsd that only you are qualified to diagnose you claim that abused animal will still wag their tail at their owner so how are you able to measure this distress in any quantifiable way have you brought up this amateur theory with any veterinarian do you think they re likely to concede that leaving a dog alone for hour constitutes abuse do you know what my dog doe when i m not at home he flip on his back and sleep he doe this until i get home and then we go for a walk at some point he eats dog food and i give him a good pet this is his life and it s a pretty great one compared to the life he would lead on the street or in the wild or euthanized in some shelter what you re saying is so completely ludicrous on it face that i ca nt believe you are nt totally embarrased to even write it down for other people to see you re basically arguing that every dog in new york city with working owner is a of right now being abused if you really believe that you should call peta right now to let them know so that they can send in the chopper and mount a rescue mission are you insane tl dr try therapy leave people and their pet alone
NONE i live in an apartment no yard no dog park he can go outside only when i take him on walk me and my wife work and he stay home alone if we work at the same time i agree with a fair amount of what you are saying he could have a better life but the existence of a better life doe not necessarily mean his life is bad this is my main point he wa a rescue dog he needed a home or he would spend the rest of his probably short life in a kennel at the pound he is much happier with u than what his fate would be if he wa not adopted now he might have had a better household adopt him my counter to this is a household go out expressly to adopt a dog they then adopt approximately the number of dog they intended to get from the beginning this mean if a better household adopted my dog they would not have adopted what ever dog they actually wound up with so there would still be a dog in a kennel waiting for a home or death edit decided to add more in something to think about how exciting is your life while you are at work if you have a cubicle job like many people than you have le room then your dog doe how good a life do we need to provide for our pet that is so much higher then our own life would you tell people they should not live their life because they can only do fun thing for a few hour every day why is a dog life so much different do nt forget what the alternative is for current dog in this predicament the only way to get them out is to kill them for future dog you must answer this question is it better to be board while your human are at work or not exist at all

NONE well the truth a i see it is that other publisher will hop on that bandwagon too but defiantly not every publisher nor will it fully ruin the future of gaming have you heard of the publisher paradox interactive they are probably the main reason i have faith in the future of gaming and other minor publisher and indie devs and the reason i like them is probably also the reason they have grown a whole lot more popular in the past few year those reason being they have great communication with the community and they have a usually great dlc policy especially compared to other publisher a far a i m care their game always feel complete upon release and whenever they release a dlc it is accompanied by a fair bit of free content which benefit everyone even year after release yeah they do some bullshit thing to with their cosmetic dlc but at least that doe nt effect the gameplay i also have high hope for some more popular franchise like fallout last time when skyrim came out the preorder bonus wa an out of game map the dlc s also seemed reasonable and complete and so far then have done nothing to show that f will be any different anyways i have only bought one or two aaa title in the past two or so year primarily because of the reason you have mentioned it s a sad problem and will probably always be around but it will never be everywhere if people like you give your money to developer who are nt sleazy but there are so many other great game out there right now that focusing on a handful of popular franchise is pointless if you do nt like a publisher fucking you in the as do nt give them money to fuck you in the as
AH you use a lot of deflection mechanism you have a pedogloss i ve seen this before you try to get the truth to slide off of you baby torturing scum

NONE i said it ca nt possibly have been justified since there is no proof a of now perhaps someone ha come up with a proof that you re unaware of or perhaps you are aware of the proof but you re mistakenly unconvinced by it i can assume my computer exists because i can see it touch it smell it etc why limit our definition of objective to thing that are known through the sens for example i think it s objectively true that everything is the same a itself aa or that a proposition ca nt be both true and false a a i ca nt conceive of how i would know of those objective truth through my sens it s true i might see particular instance of these truth through my sens but i would nt perceive the generalized form of these truth through my sens instead i know those truth through my intuition morality is pretty much by definition subjective i do nt think so i presented several argument why it ca nt be here http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsdwamcmvtherearenoobjectivemoraltruthsallmoraldipy but if you do nt want to read that i understand i simply have a challenge for you if morality is subjective whose preference doe morality depend on society s each individual s god s i would argue that for any answer you give it would be reasonable to ask why care about that agent s preference

NONE those example are pretty polarizing though no those are not polarizing or outlier to the norm those are the norm and sorry most people do nt want to see a woman in the men s restroom but hey let s get some perspective on this i m a transwoman you know what i miss getting to stand to pee in public you think i want to sit on a nasty as toilet every time hell no but hey part of being a girl in public and all either way look at it this way if we start telling people got ta be in the restroom you were born in and transguys look that masculine guess what that s now a free pas for any guy to just start using any bathroom unless we re going to start pant checking so think about that any guy could just burst in and claim he ha a vag and we ca nt stop him further sorry but it s not anyone else s business to know if someone s trans or not so no it s not okay to force someone out especially not when murder of trans people are so damn high

AH wow you really need a hobby
NONE i love it super clever idea
AH to your detriment i actually opened and read the link you gave hq is still simply wrong and a loser for lying about it and derailing the whole debate into his little tirade “ free will ” is a philosophical term of art for a particular sort of capacity of rational agent to choose a course of action from among various alternative which is exactly the definition i used that hq said wa wrong this stand true for all the subsequent form of free will that follow for each variety of determinism there are philosopher who i deny it reality either because of the existence of free will or on independent ground ii accept it reality but argue for it compatibility with free will or iii accept it reality and deny it compatibility with free will with this the entry introduces at least different version of free will all of which contain my initial definition and out of which the one the op gave a the god true definition is only one of it s actually you who have have have forfeited the argument by moving away from the issue at hand going into a rant on the metadiscussion and claiming some sort of accusation of malintent here in the presence of a perfectly reasonable response wrong this whole thing started with hq claiming the ops definition of free will wa wrong and subsequently doing it to me a well despite my definition being the common one that is included in all of the other version later hq forced me to pick a subpath which still doe nt change the fact that what i said is a part of all the version and what he said is only a part of one of them that is exactly what intellectual dishonesty is knowing something and still claiming something else because it seems like the way to win an argument
NONE i m not the same person a the rest of this comment thread but this one response stand out to me it just seems like we just take one of the definition to be the more prominent definition this is an inherent problem of language take for example the sentence the bartender s punch wa quite strong if i said this to you there are two completely valid assumption the first that the bartender ha struck with their fist someone or something near the speaker the second that the bartender mix a highly alcoholic drink in the argument here you say being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is moral grandstanding then when someone offer you a definition of the possibly unconditional acceptance of tolerance you explain that your own definition is the one you are choosing to take but you are not in a position to make that statement a you are not the original speaker or one who identifies with the statement it is equivalent to use the previous example of saying the bartender s punch is strong and you arguing that the bartender is wrong for hitting thing when the original speaker wa just talking about their beverage once clarification of language is offered you do not have the ability to argue that another definition wa originally being used because it ha been clarified if the person you are arguing with is using b to accept despite this direction would be a valid counterargument but they are nt so the counterargument of i choose to use another definition despite your clarification in order to maintain my previously held view fall a bit flat in many way the statement being tolerant of everyone but the intolerant is an argumentatively unclear statement but it repetition ha likely seen the increase of it use
AH please if you had a brain it wa fucking obvious this wa a war of choice which is a war crime the rest of the dumb public were being lied to on a mass scale but thats no excuse for politician who knew better
NONE i could virtually say the same for the u a you would have to be a cop or some type of security that prof it is necessary i m military and there is no way i could get one if i wa not on the clock
AH i do nt know whether they re suffering and i did nt see you asking them anything about it i know we are suffering obvious is obvious i m out if you need to feel free to have the last word this is the comment of a sick little boy who is so desperate to win he ha to lie to and manipulate himself in order to get what he want get help you are sick and you are suffering for it
NONE while it seems like you re just focusing on stuff that annoys you i do see what you mean sjws and people in the medium are quick to point finger and call people racist homophobic prejudice etc but that s not going to help it s just going to make people more careful with what they say discussion is what would help these issue but we wo nt get to that point if we ca nt get passed the initial name calling
AH you re exaggerating the trauma of rape in your own head precisely because you are not a woman you re projecting your fear onto woman and then turning this into some sort of contest of victimhood wherein your security is maintained by pretending that woman are somehow more vulnerable than you will ever be your opinion is disqualified since you clearly can not remain objective
NONE it s such a broad movement i doubt you ll find anyone who can make a convincing argument to reject the whole thing there are thyroid condition and other issue that make being overweight far more likely than the average person when you re fat regardless of personal effort it s hard to justify anyone judging you for it so yes it definitely ha it place in my eye
AH i happen to agree but i do nt think that this is a obvious a you re making it out to be you re wrong are people responsible for the unintended consequence of hitting their genitalia together yes if yes that might be a counterargument to bodily autonomy style prochoice argument i do nt see how unless you believe that terminating a pregnancy is somehow not taking responsibility for the unintended consequence of hitting their genitalia together which is of course a foolish thing to believe
NONE if you see the thing you re participating in a destructive why participate at all you may not have obligation in this scenario but that doe nt mean you do nt have a choice for example you can choose to walk away from that situation and everyone involved will be better off for it nothing is made better by the argument we make to deflect blame worse than that you re selling yourself short a a moral agent when you stop caring whether your action hurt people a long a blame can be placed elsewhere
AH silly nonthinking atheist lol muted
NONE found the religious atheist
AH racial profiling wa invented to catch serial killer who are almost always middle aged white men are you seriously arguing that racial profiling wa targeted at white people do you realize just how retarded you sound right now
NONE not racist at all in fact a lot of poster here need to check the definition of racism i do not find black woman sexually attractive do nt know why i just do nt never have and if that trend continues then i never will
AH no i m not ignoring that at all you d be able to tell if you actually read my fucking post yeah sure a a trend yeah that s about right of them vote democrat it seems that hispanic and asian make a cultural conversion by about the th or th generation i have stated numerous time that it is a significant majority of these racial group that vote a certain way and that the ideological disparity decrease with each generation you and this other guy need to learn how to fucking read i m sick of it
NONE i believe the point wa that a woman experience it men are more likely to be patronizing to them likely this is nt at all intentional i have to fight myself all the time when it come to automatic assumption about other woman and i am one if your automatic mindless assumption is that you know more about a subject because you are a dude and dude in general tend to know more about train say then you re much more likely to jump into a conversation and embarrass yourself in front of a woman railway engineer and woman notice this

NONE i m always confused by this entire argument altogether right now sitting in your house or wherever there are probably a dozen way to quickly and painlessly kill yourself now you are nt going to do it because like you explained but you could so i do nt get why you have to have the right to do it you can commit suicide whenever and when your dead it s not like anyone can punish you so why do you even care
AH my latin is rusty but according to wikipedia an ad hominem is when an individual responds to argument by insulting a person character rather than responding to the argument itself i gave you a label a a cranky person because your first comment wa filled with some seemingly angry statement or did i misinterpret that too everything else wa argumentive
NONE what i mean by emotional argument is when a person us their personal view and value you d be very hard pressed to find an argument that is nt influenced in some way by a person s belief and value i agree with your overall point but i do nt think it applies at all to the example you gave in your post rejecting change out of fear however is a good example
AH i m glad objectivity is more important to you than being partisan how s that sociology or communication degree treating you tip going well at work
NONE the best answer i can give you for this cmv is that it s a very irrelevant question and is impossible to answer and a waste of time to think about
AH i think you re obviously trolling you seem to be implying that all transgender by definition trick nontransgender into sleeping with them by withholding the fact that they are transgender do you really believe this your first statement wa that transgender people lie and now you re jumping here jesus christ

AH do you honestly believe the main reason black child grow up without father is because those men are in jail i agree that applies to a minority group of them but i think we both know the main reason so essentially what you ve done here is engaged in emotional ad hominem attack on my personal character without responding with a logical answer that s very progressive of you what i ve noticed you progressive do in debate is take the ostensible moral high road in doing so your argument are devoid of logic and boil down to either you agree with me or you re racistbigoted there s no chance in having an honest discussion you re so strung out on emotion it blind you and it just becomes nonstop personal insult i can only say you owe it to yourself to wake up and smell the rose especially if you re a male
NONE the point is that you keep bringing up specific case in your argument while i am saying that it s not indicative of systematic oppression this is a huge problem that people think this way i am a white male and face something bad at the hand of womenblack people so therefore white male clearly are nt overall the one on top it make sense that someone like that would struggle to see past their own world but that doe nt make it right so again if you agree with me that when we look at all of society and how it view men and woman in general society favor men then can you see how a gendered word would be needed to describe it i am resorting to insult because you keep trying to argue something completely different which is that men can get shit on too i know they can it s why i disagree with the feminist definition of privilege
AH you see black people had it bad for a long time so it s okay to be asshole to all white people now if you do nt understand that you re either stupid or racist see i said everything you said but with le self importance
NONE thanks technically there are no halfdeltas but you can definitely award a delta if your view ha been partially changed or if i brought up something you had nt yet considered it s up to you if you want to do that
AH you have all those degree and you still did nt know the answer to this question that any student who passed physic i would know http wwwredditcomraskredditcommentsxldoesthedepthshapeofamassiveobjectdetermine i do nt believe you
NONE yes i agree with what you say i also have nt worked out how all the detail would work but i have an intuitive sense that it could be done if you describe what specific issue you see with collateral and protection i ll start thinking about it
AH having sex with someone after drinking for instance is automatically rape your opinion is extremely radical and in no way reflects the letter of the law stop spreading misinformation you agenda driven shit
NONE how doe this apply to your claim that singing the nword in a song or hearing it in a quote should merit retribution a well what kind of idiot is going to infer violence from someone using the word in that manner
AH i m not sure how to prove that a good test should be consistent between day that seems pretty self evident i m asking you to provide the claim that iq tester make about the capability of the test your personal experience are impossible to objectively verify so they ca nt be used to prove anything to anybody but yourself this is not an attack on you personally it s just the safe thing to do when it come these sort of thing if it can alter the result by two standard deviation then it clearly too open to bias from the administrator your personal experience are impossible to objectively verify so they ca nt be used to prove anything to anybody but yourself a test that is influenced by factor that it is not testing is a bad test it should only provide result on the factor it is trying to test every test is a bad test by this metric that is not my standard for a good or bad test if you want to change my view you need to show it s a bad test by other metric and in relation to the claim made by iq tester and test maker edit the downvote is not a disagree button this cmv is just furthering my belief that this is a very politically motivated topic
NONE i ll try to outline the alternative case in order to test for anything you need a hypothesis if you try to make observation based on what seems out of the ordinary your conclusion will always be subjective in more formal statistical term there is no way to test a statistical test to make sure that it s the right test or if there is there is no way to do so for that test ad infinitum you will always end up making assumption based on your platonic ideal for instance suppose the average of some series seems out of the ordinary relative to it comparables well how do you know that taking the average wa the right thing some series do nt have a stable average because their outlier are so extreme in real life you will never get to take the limit a the sample size approach infinity for obvious reason you will simply have to make a subjective judgement a to when you have seen enough the idea of a series with a stable average is a nice platonic ideal it may not entirely correspond to reality but it s much better to have it in mind in a theoretical sense before you start your observation so that you re not influenced by how you want your result to look
AH did you read all of mine if you re a dolt then i am too but please continue insisting on being offended to justify not doing some basic soulsearching
NONE i m not going to try to convince you otherwise i feel you have it spot on and these response do not excuse or clarify any of it you are correct and i disagree a an american with anything anyone say otherwise ignorant maybe but i m right
AH totally untrue i believe that all female should be equal to male the thing is they already are there is no cent on the dollar there is no manspreading there is no mansplaining not all male are inherently sexist what i have a issue with is the feminist that push to be equal and also have special privilege if you want to be a equal a a man be prepared to be treated like a man it is a simple a that i have an issue with that feminist are more ready to bitch about manspreading and mansplaining rather then push and support woman organization and right in majority muslim country such a saudi arabia woman are nt even allowed to drive in most of the middle east but please continue bitching about the fake wage gap and how manspreading is a symbol of the patriarchy we make meme making fun of those issue but you never see popular meme calling for woman not to be able to vote or that they ca nt drive they are against this pc b being shoved down our throat for the past year
NONE it is a form of pandering in the sense that these company which feature pocs in ad are trying to make themselves look le racistmore inclusive to appeal to pocs most pocs desire for that it is natural for people to dislike being marginalised it is harmful in the fact that the company use the notion that they ve included pocs in their ad to dismiss the idea that the re racist sometimes these pocs may even be included to propagate stereotype for example a company may include an asian woman dressed up a geisha in it ad when people point out that this is racist the company tends to be like we re not a we ve included a woc if we re really racist we wo nt have included an asian woman in the first place so this lead to the issue of pocs being included a token modelscharacters only to make these company look le racist and progressive and hence morally superior it is dehumanising to only include pocs a token for your own benefit pocs are underepresented a main character in movie and tv series they are often only included a token character
AH wtf is this wall of text if you had a legitimate point you would nt burry it
NONE if you concede that point doe that mean that a part of your view is changed
AH yes that ha more credibility i see so irs employee are le able to lie than other government employee because other people are able to look at the tax record and objectively and definitively say whether or not calculation were correct and whether or not payment wa made then why the objection to due process if there is concrete evidence then certainly minute in a courtroom should be a slam dunk procedure in the hypothetical murder witnessed by a cop no one is able to rewitness the murder andor objectively and definitively say the cop s interpretation of what he saw wa accurate so you are willing to give judge and jury status to an irs agent who ha to provide none of the evidence you say that can be objectively defined but not to the cop whose objectivity is in question i remember you from previous trolling you ve done you re canadian and have no idea how american law work the irs doe nt present you with tax record they seize your asset and hand you a statement saying how much they seized you do nt get a why or a record
NONE would it change your opinion if the statistic were even more skewed than that because i m pretty sure a lot of people do nt report rape specifically because they correctly believe that there is insufficient evidence to convict the rapist they are likely in a better position to decide that than you are what if all reporting it would accomplish is for the statistic to become of all rapist being convicted is someone still obligated to report a case that they genuinely do nt think will a go to trial or b result in a conviction also you re discounting the nontrivial number of case where the victim is nt even sure at the time whether or not they were raped that sound weird but when you re talking about situation with consent involved where consent is far more common than nonconsent and where intoxication is frequently involved it should nt be that surprising that people are confused at the time but later clarify their understanding
AH this single issue should be at the top of everyone s list when comparing the presidential candidate the candidate stance on climate change is absolutely irrelevant to their ability a chief executive of the usa besides some of u do nt scare nearly a easily a you do some of u realise the entire reason humanity evolved is because the climate changed so dramatically that we had to leave the tree because the tree were dying later we had to go down into the river valley because the grassland were turning to desert from there we migrated across the world battling each new climate region we came across survived three ice age and here we are the notion that the changing climate is going to get u is facile and cowardly adapt or die you simpering child
NONE do nt most president get reelected incumbency is a huge advantage however it is certainly not insurmountable see bush i m not sure that they could nt be convinced that thing have gotten much better for the rest of the country speaking in abstract is tricky because the overall felling of the country will stem largely from individual perspective in relation to their own prospect i think trump connected with a large part of the working class of the country that felt they were nt poor enough to get the special treatment and their prospect were nt good enough that they felt they could climb the economic ladder those are the people i speak of and if they do nt feel their prospect change then the door is open for someone who brings that message to them in
AH there are teen year old it cost around for room and board per year at college and that is a lot cheaper than it would be to build maintain and staff housing for million teen supervisor so right off the bat you have an extremely lowball estimate of billion dollar just to house and feed these kid you re either trolling nut or both
NONE just need to remember that wa higher than and almost higher than if i had to guess the typical bump from internet voting would only be around which would be hugely expensive the aca website cost billion dollar it would be on every antiusa hacker list each november mailin voting is likely the answer for now over internet voting
AH you agist motherfucker for many old people peeing standing up is clearly superior getting on and off the toilet can be challenging and pee is more likely to get stuck in your shitty as collapsing urethra in the sitting position than in the standing not to mention just plain ole speed of peeing when you re old not only is it hard to get down and up it take time
NONE i am happysad to say that they ve all failed and you re right i have a baby that we work hard to put to sleep then some dickhead who could nt get enough attention a a child need to compensate for his fucked up childhood and small penis by reving his piece of shit with a loud exhaust up and down the street wake up our baby fuck those guy
AH fuckoff jew do nt come cry back to poland when the arab finally push you colonizer into the sea p germany started world war to recapture territory lmfao lmfao lmfao lmfao there is no lmfao big enough your view is nt worth changing or your argument addressing because you are flat out buck retarded pps history start at and the teutonic order did nt massively and illegally overstep their mandate a invitee or anything retard
NONE you took the word right out of my mouth i feel exactly like you except i ve been watching this shit show ten year longer i will vote though not because i want to but because i want to send a loud fuck you to the dnc i ll cast jill stein and if enough people do it with me it will drag the dnc more left in many country voting for the most left is what force the main party to throw the occasional bone to the working mass
AH most of your example there are simply the case of you not doing any googling and you end up using a more advanced problem than you can handle dude you and your attitude can go fuck yourself you have no way of knowing how much googling i wa doing
NONE yeah and it doe nt work for some people that s true of literally everything if you re looking for something that people do that s optional and that also applies to everyone then your view is simply unfalsifiable what do you expect me to do with that
AH lmao when a td user get in way over his head
NONE the difference should be made up when it fall short
AH you and i both know that if someone genuinely doe nt see themselves a part of the culture they were born in they would not identify with it you can be part of a culture without identifying with it though it would be wholly innacurate to consider that person part of that culture i do nt care if you disagree because feminism is an ideology not a culture and it wa really stupid of you to compare it to christianity and culture someone absolutely is nt part of an ideology that they do nt identify with agreed you re the one that brought it though absolutely but this whole religious discussion started with you connecting thing to christianity but i digress are you even being serious right now are you really that blind that wa me responding to your point about christianity youre the one that first mentioned christianity
NONE we no longer need religious text to help u understand life my point wa that since we still do nt have the tool to understand life and the nature of existence there is still a need for religion until science can definitively say we exist because of x reason and here s why there is always going to be an element of faith when trying to explain one s purpose that s a question you ca nt deny people from trying to answer and a religious answer is just a valid a any other because it s really anyone s guess what existed before the big bang can scientist prove the earth is more than year old of course but science can not prove or disprove the existence of god note i m not religious or particular to any one religion and until modern science can definitively understand why we are here there is always going to be an element of religion in human culture
AH please do nt feel like i m insulting you but you sound like a lonely needy bitch that is not fun to be around if you were a nice and enjoyable person your place could be worse than a public toiled in the drinking and drug part of town and people would still come to visit that is also why you go to those friend you complain about you want to hang out sure you bitch about their place but you are not there for the place but the people right if you want to see a movie go to a cinema want to drink go to a bar sure doing that at your place sound fun but do you want to be that guy others just hang out with because he ha nice stuff hey look i got money and i give you some of it so be my friend that is like the story of richie rich and remember what happened they did nt want to be friend with him because of all his cool stuff but because he wa a fun guy to be around so no there is no expectation of you to visit them because you want to do it or not you could just stay at your mancave and party alone so i agree there is no expectation but also you completely missed the point why human socialize
NONE warning this is an unpopular opinion if you look for thing to be offended by skip my post i personally hate normal people they disgust me why the fuck would you want to be like everyone else get a dream get some aspiration get a role model i ca nt stand people who do nt want to change the world most wo nt but i ve met very few people who want to be andrew carnegie or die trying average people do nt do anything with their life they get married have kid and then workwatch television for the rest of their life their kid grow up to be just like them normal are nobody s if you want to follow the road most traveled do nt expect to achieve more than the average joe if you want people to stop calling you basic stop acting like it stop doing what television and commercial tell you to do and think and wear it sound like your a bit of a follower and a passive aggressive one at that complaining about your friend in a place they wo nt see it who other than you give a fuck what your basic friend think they re basic bird of a feather flock together side note if you got a problem with them saying it bring it up with them not with random people on the internet who have nt called you name you do nt like it doe nt sound like you want your view changed it sound like your complaining
AH they fact that you ignored my post and inserted your own interpretation speaks volume to the degree of crazy you are i m talking about the word they and you had to completely ignore that a well a put word into my mouth in order to make what i have to assume wa your point there is nothing exclusive about they it doe nt even have to refer to human my dog is sick they got into my chocolate it doe nt even have to refer to animate object i got some grocery they are in the car for fuck sake they can even refer to abstract concept ever have discussion with narcissistic idiot on the internet they are so tiring so i ll paraphrase again what i ve said elsewhere in this thread if you get offended by being referred to a they you need to see a psychiatrist you are a crazy person
NONE if you are on fb you can make the assumption that they are curated what i do nt understand is why you think your opinion is so important to be heard that you feel the need to force it on people who do nt want to hear it why ca nt you just post it on your own page i do nt mean this rudely i m curious i had a friend who wa the wife of an evangelical minister she posted horrible stuff about a number of topic but it wa nt appropriate for me to correct them on her page i did end up hiding her post because i could nt take them any more it s not a city street because you ve invited only certain people in to your fb page you expect these friend to support you not attack you your page is a safe space for you it s not at all a street that s open to the public
AH i do nt know how you manage your movement and your body but for me falling in the toilet is nt a possibility because i look if i ca nt see i do nt sit i understand that it s inconvenient to turn on a light when you re sleepy but tough shit we re grown ups and can handle it whatever guy i do nt really care what you think it s not a big deal it s just much smarter to just put the toilet seat down because it s really fucking simple and that way you never have to turn on light at night you can do whatever the fuck you want in your own place i do nt really give a shit in my place i prefer to leave the light off and use the toilet that way it s really easy to do but if the toilet seat is up i wo nt notice until i sit down that s why leave the toilet seat down exists that s why it is sensible if you do nt think so i really do nt care you do nt have to why are you even fucking arguing about it go argue with someone else about meaningless crap i m just explaining to you why it make sense to choose the toilet seat down a the default position rather than up there is a logic to it it is actually sensible holy shit some people on the internet
NONE i mean you do nt have to say it that way you can just say sorry but in your head mean i m sorry you feel that way the problem seems to be that you do nt want to let them win but this situation is nt really about that when it come down to it it s about trying not to make people feel bad if someone belief something so far from what you believe that you do nt think you could ever reconcile it it s probably best to not be around that person however if you care about these people it s more about figuring out what upset them and then avoiding those thing when you re around them i ll give you an extreme example if i think it s totally cool to shit on the floor and i go to someone s house for a party and just openly take a big ol shit on the floor i think there may be some issue that arise likely that person would take offense here there are two option if i care more about keeping my identity my right to defecate where i please etc i ll likely tell the person that it s not my problem they re offended by me take me a i am or not at all that type of thing if i care more about the relationship i would instead clean up after myself and apologize then later i d ask what the issue wa exactly and discus how to not upset them in that way anymore of course this is much more extreme than your case but hopefully the point come across
AH the bernie thing wa a strategy that worked so shitting on your ally acting with disrespect in a moronic fashion this is strategy the end do nt justify the mean yo if you dislike the movement for the last reason then your opinion is irrelevant to me here wow you re a dick you came here asking for people opinion then tell them they re irrelevant to you are such a sensitive daisy that you ca nt accept contrary opinion still have value
NONE the fact that they offer an explanation you find unconvincing make them somehow lacking in intelligence ok now i understand your position let me ask you another question then do you believe that people who express any argument that you find unconvincing about any topic are unintelligent or is it limited to the religious arena a a kind of follow up question do you believe it s possible for intelligent people to be wrong about something if so why is religion somehow special
AH ok once again stop fucking telling me how i m going to feel you know what just fuck off
NONE but then what will we say when we re really angry fuck you ha no meaning so what should i say if i m really fucking pissed
AH i wa just making sure you understood the word imply is very similar to the word suggest because that s exactly what the ad doe it state there are enemy it state they are violent and dangerous it state they should be fought with the clenched fist of truth it state the viewer should join that fight it follows those statement by reminding the viewer that this nice message of division come from an organization centered around object used to shoot people nice ad hominem though classy oh and playing that you did nt understand my question to make me look dumb clever rhetorical strategy you have there
NONE you view state that calling voter just annoys them i feel that while it may annoy them that s not the only thing it doe it can also put certain name in the mind of voter it ha been fairly well established that people are more likely to choose someone or something that they re familiar with this is why the primary goal of advertising is not to get you to immediately buy a product it s to put a name in your head with the hope that you ll remember it and be more likely to choose it in the future with that in mind while it may be true that political call can annoy people that is not the only thing they do
AH oh my you are such a privileged and foolish child i sincerely hope that you somehow read this thread in year when your biggest concern is nt your completely unnecessary ap physic trip i promise you you will be completely and utterly ashamed of yourself
NONE how about confidence is the choice to ignore possibility that you could be wrong that you can not account for you can acknowledge thing that genuinely prove you wrong but lacking those you assume that nothing will no worrying about unfalsifiable hypothetical
AH it s called being condescending you manhating weirdo
NONE i agree with you it should also be called a maamname
AH i can find idiot doing all sort of thing do we need to control for idiot constantly i fell for it myself it seems good day
NONE why only offer it if they re that crazy they ca nt make those kind of decision anyway just shoot them and be done with it
AH your incomprehension i do nt understand how you and your principle a person doe not control their thought are at complete odds are you honestly an idiot when i m saying i do nt understand how you i m speaking of the self in a colloquial sense because we need to refer to the pile of mushy wet matter that comprises us in some way to be able to have a conversation however that doe nt mean the self a you d like to believe it exists on a determinist premise you should nt be surprised infact your emotional response point to what you really believe that you and i yourself and myself both exist and your application of effort to use reason albeit poor one on another is worth your time because it can change belief welcome to selfdetermination lol no this is an incredibly naive way to think being able to change the belief of another ha nothing to do with free will i am simply acting a another piece of environmental stimulus when i m typing to you you re either going to absorb the information and ruminate on it and realize i m correct or you re going to discard it out of hand because you ve already developed a worldview that s impervious to logic and reasoning to be completely honest i know i m already done with you you seem to be too dogmatically stuck in your belief and desperately want free will to be a thing i m continuing to respond for the sake of others that might be following the comment chain and want a different perspective i honestly ca nt even believe you just said that last part though it s like your understanding on this topic is so binary that you have nt really thought about it at all to think that someone s belief changing is somehow an indication of free will is incredibly naive
NONE i m basically scared of losing my moral compass because of my skewed thought this thouht keep me up at night i think of the people i care about and i feel nothing i do nt know if it is because i am a horrible person or that i ve been so stressed out and and it killed my emotion so i have been trying to find a counterargument against these thought spending entire day of the internet trying to find the answer to prove that the good moral life is the best way and the immoral route brings self destruction i just want to make you aware of an important concept in psychology to help you defray some of the fearguilt you may feel about this insight http enwikipediaorgwikiinsight psychiatry the article i linked talk about it in the context of mental illness but i do nt mean to suggest you re mentally ill i mean to suggest that your ability to understand that your thought are skewed or abnormal and your strong reaction to them indicates that you are not in fact at risk of doing anything harmful to anyone many people who truly do whatever they want psychopath or sociopath fully lack awareness that what they are doing is immoral or if they are aware of it fail to understand why they should care let alone any sense of actual compassion on the other hand lot of people have intrusive thought that can be irrational amoral or just terrifying if you are able to say this seems wrong even if i want to do it right now you are already doing better than they are at this i d like you to try this exercise deabstract the thing you think about imagine how you would feel after doing something bad if you stole from a store for instance and got away with it would you only feel happy that you now have property you did nt have before or would you feel guilty even if that guilt wa not enough to make you return the stolen item or not steal in the first place
AH getting a lil defensive there huh
NONE damn yo that s some good talkin
AH socialist is a adjective that describes people a well a society so is fascist so is communist you really need to learn to grammar patriarchy is an idea noun it s a concept patriarchal is an adjective used to describe society not people the word ha never been used against you ever so it is not a slur this is exactly what bigot say to defend their insensitive and hateful word seriously how is patriarchy hateful it is literally what our society is would you claim that calling our society a fucking democracy is a slur the word is not about you stop making it about you an actual slur for men is shit like manwhore or dick or asshole or douche grow some fucking perspective god damn stop thinking people discussing actual fucking issue in our society is a direct attack on you the difference is gender nope the difference is that they re different part of speech and used completely differently it s not a slur because it literally doe not describe men you seriously do nt seem to understand what a slur is you have the nerve to call me a kid and immature in the same conversation a this you are beyond immature i m done
NONE please choose one it not an insult to gay people so because when you want to insult someone the quickest way to portray that someone is acting effeminate etc is to call them gay for you say it s not an insult then you say it is i m confused if you are using someone s identity a an insult how is that not offensive to them there certainly is a clear mainstream way gay people are portrayed it not an insult to gay people so the way the mainstream portrays group is always true you think minstrel show accurately portrayed black people when you get offended by you re cheap like a jew the negative aspect of cheap are what offend you not the jew part right you are insulted by the negative stereotype more so than being called a jew why be offended about being called a jew i m offended because stereotype about jew being cheap have been an excuse to persecute discriminate against and kill jew since the middle age http enwikipediaorgwikistereotypesofjews greed i m quite sure the generalization about woman wanting taller partner is very true the facial hair one is not a rooted in fact i ll give you that i still think it make sense though where i live japan it is quite common for men to shave body hair and pluck eyebrow japan is a society of million people and the third largest economy in the world not some obscure tribe in the amazon what s true for you is not true for all people and it is illogical to assume so
AH ok here are some now be a good libertarian and tell me that it is nt racism if it doe nt affect white college boy http wwwnberorgpaperswpdf http wwwnytimescombooksreviewwhenaffirmativeactionwaswhiteuncivilrightshtml r http filesericedgovfulltextedpdf http wbhsinetwendyplotkindeedswebfhahtml http wwwnytimescomweekinreviewbajajhtml http papersssrncomsolpaperscfm abstractid

AH she get the privilege of having men buy her drink put her on a pedestal sexually harass her tell her she s worth le than they are etc etc what fun i do nt get the privilege of men buying me drink i dont drink at all and i ve never been to a bar or a club in my life i am not a party girl to rely on men buying me alcohol i d have to be a slut and a feminist i only care about my bf i dont go out looking to get fucked i also never got sexually harassed because i dont hang out in bad crowd and i dont dress like a slut also no one told me i m worthless again because i dont hang out with bad people like that also i doubt you d know how is like to be a woman who is sexually harassed ugly feminist always complain about sexual harassment but you never see victoria secret model complain about that i bet you re like that hugh mungus crazy lady
NONE i feel like a lot of resentment that you feel towards woman can be resolved by understanding that they re just people in spite of what the internet would have you believe one way or the other depending on where you lurk they re just people some are shitty some are awesome this kind of reminds me of the other day when i told my coworker that whenever i have a fight with my girlfriend i tighten all the jar she responded well careful with that strategy or she might withhold sex for a while and at first it wa such a bizarre idea to me because nobody in real life ever suggested that a an option but i just replied she actually enjoys sex a much a i do so that d just hurt her too what kind of terrible sex have you been having that you do nt actively want sex sometimes i feel like my relationship is weird for being caring and affectionate also slut exist

NONE i believe that each person should have a number of vote equal to the amount of federal tax paid for the previous year so you think that of the population should have more say in power than of the population http taxfoundationorgblogtoppercentpaysmoretaxesbottompercent how is a government that represents an extreme minority of the country supposed to be viewed a representative

AH my title is not all inclusive i clearly see the word almost in it additionally if you can not tell what kind of relationship are being referred to through context you do not have enough intelligence for me to determine to be worth responding to so good luck with that
NONE not everything will be reposted what if the picture that i want is the one that not many liked furthermore why should i rely on such an unreliable method to find something i can look up by the title or a partial title and get what i need rather than hoping for someone else to repost that image also you may miss it the second time around

AH she wa attempting to demonize them lol criticizing my toy is equivalent to calling me le than human she wa harassed because she antagonized a group of people some of whom were willing and able to harass her she wa harrased because she s a woman with an opinion that jackass like you do nt like harassing a person you mean at least people but yeah just forget about quinn and wu people get defensive because every single time we get brought up we re called racist or misogynist or whatever latest ist or ism is making the round we re tired of being belittled and insulted i m tired of you lot asserting that i should nt be allowed to speak my opinion on game because somehow my opinion will incite selfcensorship i m tired of you lot normalizing the racism sexism and general bigotry in gaming the conversation became about misogyny because you called an entire group of people misogynist then became defensive when asked to cite your source and provide proof well you are all i need to do is check out the all time top on kia to confirm it
NONE well i m going to respond to you by asking you to check your privilege expecting the nonprivileged to take responsibility for the education of the privileged is expecting them to give you even more privilege yes my friend did tell me this and when they did they were doing me a favour and i would never simply expect that out of them i never expected them to mollycoddle my privilege prefacing it with check your privilege would just be a bit patronisingdismissive that is in my opinion nothing more than a judgement it s not patronizing it s not dismissive how many time do you think a tall person hears how s the weather up there how many time do you think it take before it get really old when i say it the ten thousandth time he s heard it i m not going to tell him that his response of simply saying ugh wa patronizing or dismissive i m not going to demand that he treat my joke a if he s heard it for the first time because it s the first time i ve told it being in the position where your privilege can be explained to you rather than having to live with underprivilege every single day is itself a privilege
AH i never said any of that shit and you are arguing against point i never made a for your stance on climate change that s completely insane to just accept failure without trying anything because it s inconvienient and you believe it s already too late a for the vp position normally sure i would agree with you but trump already offered kasich the job handling foreign and domestic policy a his pitch to get him on board during the campaign penny will have influence trump ha no idea what the fuck he is doing and he will turn to penny more then once for advice not to mention he already promised repeal of marriage equality they are completely brainwashed sorry man you are the one ranting like alex jones calm the fuck down and try to sympathize with someone else and maybe you might understand a bit instead of seeing soros boogeyman everywhere you look i am not a hilary supporter i hate her gut
NONE regardless of his critic his base like what he is saying how he is saying it yeah so what racist like what other racist say too they re not going to shun one of their own and you should nt expect them to those who shun trump will be those who disagree with him and find him offensive enough to shun that s exactly what is already happening you ve written that instead of facing criticism for his opinions is being championed a some sort of visionary for people who s opinion do nt align with the mainstream instead of the jackass that he is i ve shown you that he is in fact being criticized for his remark he s being criticized by the medium and by member of his own party if this is nt sufficient would you please tell me how i can change your view edit spelling wtf is wrong with me today oh yeah i need to sleep

AH again with putting word into my mouth maybe you should get better at expressing your idea standing your fucking ground with a gun even if done illegally and actively threatening to shoot someone not to any standard of common sense and not to the law which is what we re talking about here not the one dictionary definition of dozen that you chose a the correct one sit in someone else s house and when they come home refuse to leave and tell them you re standing your ground and the gun is to defend yourself from the homeowner to the law that s making a threat sit in a government building refuse to leave and tell the government the gun is to defend yourself from people doing their job when they come to remove you to the law that s making a threat if the police do nt feel strongly enough to go and stop them because they are armed then they should nt have stopped them to begin with just convinced me you re too unreasonable to talk to if police are nt willing to force a shootout over a law they should nt enforce the law at all slower method that avoid people dying are proof that the law is bad grow the fuck up
NONE it is actually easier to murder someone well the law do nt change how hard it is to actually murder someone they just change how hard it is to get away with it on that front it s really easy to get away with murder if you plan it out ahead of time and the syg law do nt make any significant difference people have been getting away with murder by claiming self defense for thousand of year and they will continue to do so even if we repeal syg law running away is often the best course of action but it should never be a legal obligation otherwise if i do nt like you i can just threaten you in public and you are legally required to leave i can be on a public street and block your path and say this is my spot fuck off or i ll hurt you and you are legally required to reverse your direction and leave if you do nt leave then i can attack you and you are nt legally allowed to defend yourself you also have no way to know if i have a gun and might pull it out and shoot you in the back a soon a you turn around to try to leave duty to retreat law put aggressor and attacker at a huge advantage over victim and lead to innocent people being convicted of crime when they had no criminal intent and were just protecting themselves with necessary force

NONE it s not about believing that your attitude after the fact can effect whether you get the job or not because you re right of course it ca nt it s about believing that you re worth the job every time you choose to expect thing to go badly for yourself in order to prevent some pain down the road what you re actually doing is admitting to yourself that you re not worth it that on some level you do nt deserve to be happy or have thing go right for you because they generally have nt before so why should they now you re not one of those smiling people that life just seems to work out for it s always been different for you and no one around you seems capable of understanding that but thinking like this is only guaranteeing with complete certainty that you re always going to be drifting around in a state of semiunhappiness you may not be actually depressed all the time but it s like there s this fog that constantly surround you and since it s always there sometimes you can stop paying attention to it so much and convince yourself you re happier this way for a little while you deserve more than that though you deserve more than merely not being miserable it start with you admitting to yourself that you deserve to be happy then you make the leap

AH dollar bonus for doing their job that s not a bonus it s a salary you re calling a bonus to make everyone think you re not exploiting them a hard a you are you re exploiting people who have no choice of job it s really that simple you are the modern equivalent of a slave driver whipping the other slave for the master they re already making more money than minimum wage so what they re still not making a living wage and at they re making a quarter more than minimum wage in my state you re talking about people who should be thankful for making k a year and that s before tax should we be in awe that someone is making more than minimum wage are these people even full time i ll bet they re not because your company doe nt want to pay for health insurance do they get health insurance that s worth a lot more than a shitty a year bonus a bonus which happens to be worth about three quarter of a percentage of their yearly salary so literally nothing yeah you re a shitty manager working at a shitty business who should be ashamed of how poorly you treat your employee
NONE fairness so it s not fair that someone earns more because he either studied for a long time or just ha skill a lot of other people have nt why should nonmarketable job always be so low paying because they are nonmarketable why should a company pay someone amount x if the employee ca nt earn that amount for the company at the end i guess i would have to ask why should there be an investment because some people love to work and fulfill themselves doing so it s not a burden for them to get up in the morning will progress a a nation really slow down if there s a limit to the salary somebody can make why are you talking about a nation most company are private but of course they still are good for the nation they bring job for the people if they get taxed in a unprofitable way then they will just take their business somewhere else

AH the mental gymnastics required to reach your conclusion about hillary would make simone bile proud to believe your list about hillary you d need to believe that she intentionally committed blatant criminal act while a highranking government official and subject to scrutiny knowing she could later rely on her magical witch power to manipulate the medium political opponent and law enforcement all of whom have a direct interest and would see significant career advancement if they could demonstrably prove any of these allegation if that s the case i m not sure a greater supervillian ha ever existed in real life or fiction meanwhile you try to downplay your hilariously incomplete list of trump s negative calling his allegation of sexual abuse unverified despite many of the claim involving concurrent corroboration from witness and his own admission that he doe this sort of stuff what else do you need to verify them saying his blatantly misogynistic and racist comment are often misconstrued how should one construe blatantly misogynistic and racist comment and talking about his stance constantly changing while ignoring the fact that he s never really held any coherent policy position but rather speaks in grandiose vagary that only a schizophrenic could claim to understand the false equivalency here is breathtaking on the one hand you have a career public servant who s been under scrutiny for most of her adult life and on the other hand you have a likely sociopath who s incapable of setting the bar low enough and whose campaign strategy is essentially to crib mussolini s fascist nationalistic playbook to appeal to the most base instinct of the most benighted american to create a pitchforktoting horde whose driving force appears to be burning this whole motherfucker down and you ca nt figure out which candidate represents moral reprehensibility i suspect your view is not ripe for changing

AH firstly my condolence on the loss of a happy marriage i consider it tragic when someone a amazing a your wife get stuck with a heathen of such poor judgment i really feel for her here is why you want both a certain amount of a coffee and a certain ratio of coffee to cream if you start with the cream and you do nt have a coffee mug with a ton of extra buffer space then you are constrained in how much coffee you can add to get the right ratio now if you re goal were to have a certain amount of cream and to hell with the ratio then by all mean your method is correct additionally the cream first method that attempt to deliver on the perfect ratio might work in a coffee cup you have all the time but if you are a many are in coffee shop frequently or at friend house the only way to really control the situation is to add cream to your coffee until it s the right ratio you simply ca nt do cream first in a place like starbucks or any other place that serf the coffee for you and in friend house you ca nt be in touch with the size of the mug so a to be sure that you ve got enough room to coffeeyourcream to the right ratio lastly heaven forbid that you find yourself with percent or skim milk it own sort of tragedy here you require a different ratio than you do for cream and you need to be able to eyeball the ratio here too any reliance on i usually have this amount of milk product is shot to hell
NONE there s a couple of reason i ll do my best to do them justice liability i m assuming you are an american but if not i apologize for the assumption america is a very litigious society in an eatery for example business are obligated implicitly or explicitly to do their best to keep the customer from harm this come from telling the customer the obviously sizzling hotplate or the freshly brewed degree coffee is in fact hot and protecting them with a cloth or a coffee collar that is all to reduce liability in the case of an accident so let u explore what happens when people commonly do nt wear shoe in your establishment you would either have to toestubproof your fixture or you would have redesign your flow to reduce the number fixture around your establishment to reduce the likelihood of said accident so what s cheaper a sign that say wear shoe you nimrod or accepting that riskavoiding it through spending money i think that s a pretty logical one parasite eatery and other place that have hightraffic public movement thing like hookworm are picked up trough infected soil so people will wear shoe wait in line and track in trace amount of dirt and parasite egg like hookworm if you walk around barefoot you re going to open yourself up to more threatvectors we wear shoe for a reason
AH trying to hard to fit the narrative buddy
NONE someone need to go back to terf school
AH your response is devoid of content containing nothing resembling an argument good bit of vitriol though and so there is nothing for me to respond to you may also want to review semicolon use
NONE so you agree with me that soul are a pretty good response to a well defined and important question how doe thought and knowledge interact with the brain ie it is nt just made up and it is an answer to well defined question
AH you do nt care about mass shooting because you personally are statistically unlikely to be affected by one is nt that extremely selfish weapon capable of rapid fire and mass violence like the ar have no civilian purpose people like to play with toy is not a sufficient rationale for widespread access to something capable of and designed for such violence we live in a society and we make trade offs in order to have a better world for everyone edit changed the tone of my remark to follow the rule substance is the same
NONE are you implying that child ca nt deal with this kind of information a well a adult can yes because adult have a better capacity to understand risk eg if you explain to a year old child about nasty thing such a robbery with violence and told them the number of violent robbery there are every year they may be fully capable of understanding these thing this information may scar them emotionally a a year old would struggle to understand that the risk of this happening to them wa very small
AH no matter what you say sr is still a toxic community you are a classic sr user in that you ca nt admit when you re wrong
NONE a a conservative i appreciated this response if op doe nt give you a delta then i m not sure what will change their mind
AH or you could have read the whole post by not doing so it make you look rather ignorant
NONE i actually thought it wa great but reading your argument make me think otherwise
AH i figured it out you are basically retarded you claim you can do thing with gui editor which you ca nt then you are too stupid using vi more than once to figure out how to dd or sdummymeg but will still say npp doe regex it s equally a hard or ready to master
NONE i suppose you can if you want there s nothing in the rule that say your changed view ha to be about the original topic so i do nt see why not if you want to to do so you have to type delta without a space and a few sentence on how your view wa changed at least character
AH i have been a polite a anyone on this thread but you re been just enough of a dick for me to say this fuck you brah
NONE i m impressed you actually fessed up to being a socialist progressive how is that helping you these day
AH it s one person who is either extremely narcissistichypocritical or just trolling not worth getting worked up over
NONE i totally agree they should be unisex people use both of them anyway when someone is taking too long it s just sensible
AH how the hell do you equate it s only logical that with admitting that it s possible i ll tell you through poor logic skill and reading comprehension
NONE ok so you acknowledge i understand your position that s a good first step now let s talk about the argument that you ought to change your position
AH look you re desire for a counter factual reality is an endearing wish but it is not an argument nor is it a rational position but here s the reality today right now there are criminal who are psychologically ill they have a diagnosable illness according to the dsmv which have no known effective treatment now we can do one of three thing with these people we can imprison them we can provide them with an unproven treatment which requires the mental health professional violate an ethical standard we can experiment on them at your suggestion i might add which is also a violation of mental health profession ethic which option do you prefer if you would like some th option what is that th option if you can not provide an actual realistic legitimate option then you have no logical recourse but to admit that you were wrong your insistence on simply dismissing those who disagree with you with hand waving is not presenting a logical rebuttal it is not an argument it is in fact a violation of the rule those are low effort comment you re simply saying i disagree without reason or logic to support your position you re demonstrating yourself to be an ignorant troll
NONE i can prove to you that with marble i can prove to you that there s a moon by pointing at it i can prove to you that wa it a car or a cat i saw is a palindrome by having you read it backwards i do nt think this is possible number are simply a descriptor we give to the physical world when you deconstruct it enough we can simply substitute any one number for another and impute a different meaning to it therefore relies on certain mathematical assumption we consider properly basic and therefore nut provable likewise you ca nt point at the moon and prove it exists because you could hallucinatingdreaming etc these alternative while unlikely simply need to be possible in order to rob you of complete certainty rationality is about probability not certainty therefore if someone make a claim that pain is bad it simply depends on the moral assumption they are making it is nt necessarily feeling base in the same way that ultimately relies on our assumption about math so do our moral pronouncement where rationality come into play is helping u decide what moral assumption or worldviews best comport with reality
AH your daughter must be exceptionally bright for having finished school when her father is only thirteen year old i ve seen better troll but i would nt even expect to find one in cmv
NONE the old adage is ti better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all even if my current relationship were to end tomorrow i d still have rather spent the last year with my spouse rather than alone
AH you re retarded and just being hyperbolic neonazi free speech ha long been protected it doe nt matter how much they say it nobody is ever going to practice genocide and if they do they ll be stopped it s my right to say and believe that a certain race should be wiped off the face of the earth just a much a it is to say that one should be protected the st amendment wa nt made to protect benign speech it wa made to protect radical speech what s protected and what s not is clearly defined by the supreme court and constitution and this type of speech is if you re that upset by it it s your problem nobody is forcing you to validate it
NONE and you would nt take someone s politically incorrect speech and reword it until it resembled pc speech and say see what they said wa nt so bad i actually do this all the time to decode what trump is trying to say it is almost required in order to form an educated opinion rather than accept whichever medium hypespinsoundbite at the end of the day we probably both agree that the intention behind the speech wa not destructive but the final wording might have been now in term of this speech v a politically incorrect speech i m not sure that it should incite a similar reaction let s translate pc those people were lucky and blessed for no particular reason and that is the only reason they are successful nonpc those white people have it easy you will never have it easy because you are black
AH what the fuck is wrong with your reading comprehension i said that i upvoted a bunch of your comment
NONE my only regret is that i have only one upvote to give thank you for so eloquently stating my thought on the matter
AH quality argument do you know how i know you re a yearold troll you say cucked
NONE do you really want your view changed because frankly if i wa you i would nt change it
AH define facetious republican little shit
NONE this whole post read elitist a fuck
AH but server do nt want to change thing most of them like it this way even when they have to deal with cheap prick like you
NONE people do nt do all sort of thing because they re coward not new so stand up against anything that you disagree with
AH no it is a button for condensing asshole
NONE this is just a rant with no clear point
AH jésus christo self victimizing much here in the real world we make call based on statistic here in the real world if someone win game in a row we kick them out because they re cheating and every single time they are cheating parroting fallacy you do nt understand doe nt make you correct and clearly you have zero experience with fraud in the real world so i m done here
NONE i completely agree i ve been saying this for year it creates a worse scenario because when you have to pick a name someone will be hurt when we all do th ed same thing in uniform it take away the tension i know the feminist will hate this but can we just all agree to do this not for misogynistic reason but just in the name of efficiency
AH whether or not any of the content is true there are few thing that he should have known the presence of biological bias between men and woman ha little to no impact on the presence of cultural bias between men and woman were he to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that achieving representation is impossible it would still not address the oodles of paper that demonstrate bias against certain group across pretty much all system leading up to getting hired by a major tech firm when he argues that google should end program promoting woman in early stem career path he is arguing that the representation of certain group in these field a it is today is optimal this is not supported by evidence that this is a touchy subject a much a we might like this to be about pure science you are dealing with thing that affect people personally an unsolicited document wa bound to create backlash no matter how well sourced i do nt work at google i m at a different major but i assume that google is something like my company where there are diversity program that are absolutely looking for input and help from employee he could have gone to these people and hashed out idea with expert perhaps this would nt have worked but it certainly would nt have caused a shitstorm when you need to fire up the pr machine to handle a situation like this your contribution to the company start to look like a net negative really really quickly while the shitstorm wa very clearly kicked up by it being published externally it seems like there wa an internal shitstorm happening before even that happened all that said threat of violence against this man are obviously outrageously unacceptable
NONE it seems from my viewpoint that the public is already largely apathetic where do you get your view from my view is limited by medium consumption which is mostly pb and npr along with reddit and some random other content i do nt think the public is apathetic though i think it s a more complicated situation of burnout over too many thing to be outraged or concerned about so they limit their concern to high priority andor personally affecting issue i can grant that this is just a personal assessment based on limited information but still considering the medium attention given to issue that re well le than valid at this point imho there s plenty of space for men s right to fill should we get past some of the frankly absurd and pointless thing that capture the attention of the general public at any given moment i m not saying that s an easy thing to achieve but not impossible either could i see some example where this happened for an issue at least similar in scale to a men s issue like male suicide well take the nra somewhere between of the public support universal background check the nra ha it grip on a highly politically active and important subsection of the population such that it ha maintained high level of political power and importance despite being very small numerically many people do nt care either way but a a person who s sold gun at a department store i can tell you that there s an intense minority that flips out about anything gun related and they re highly effective in politics partly due to being present in swing state in substantial number but that s a whole other side issue i guess
AH not true now you are going at speed limit and you see a car frantically blinking and hoking for you to get the fuck out of your way what will you think you automatically jumped to conclusion that the person is asshole and want to break a law because the lane is too slow or something so you want to presumably teach him a lesson or be spiteful and not let him through whatever he doe will wait after all when in reality the guy ha a bleeding brother at the back seat he cut himself at the saw and is bleeding out at alarming speed and he begs you with tear in his eye to let him through i do nt give a fuck if there is an emergency than you know what that guy should have done called a fucking ambulance instead you think i should let someone who should nt be driving in the first place continue to be a danger to everyone else what about the next driver who panic because of the honking and flashing and get into an accident your example is fucking retarded and only bolster op s point your assumption just cost someone s life and that is why you should not block traffic purposefully your best bet is to get out of the way if you can while the driver behind you may just be an asshole it may also be someone with a medical emergency a partner in labour a child having a diabetic attack or a tree surgeon bleeding to death in any case letting them past you doe nt affect you in any way and may save a life these scenario are nt likely but they also are nt impossible it doe nt fucking matter in every single one of your stupid scenario should not have someone driving let me spell it out for your dumb as a m b u l a n c e that s what everyone in a medical emergency should be in not in a car with some fucking spazz who ca nt even see the road properly and is speeding and being a danger to everyone else
NONE i think your judgement is a little misplaced say you lend a friend or family member some money and then it turn out they re a jerk and never pay you back you can still be surprised and offended by it even if it s a thing that can totally happen and happens all the time even if you lend another friend money and they do nt pay you back either why are you at fault for just trying to help your friend and family that s a normal thing to do and people do it all the time right is nt it the jerk who wo nt pay you back who should be scorned that s your money damn it anyway it s the same with nude nude are taken all the time it s become a part of our culture there are jerk in the fold who misuse their lover trust the onus should nt be on the sender to be distrusting of everyone we should try to discourage crappy behavior it doe nt just apply to nude it applies to any situation where someone take advantage of another person not returning money not keeping a secret scamming people hacking their bank account harassing people walking down the street whatever spreading nude without another person s permission is at more or le the same level of crappiness and anyone who fall victim to those thing should be able to be surprised and offended also do your view also apply to say teenager and other people with very little life experience some people are just very naivesheltered and it is nt their fault not everyone ha had a person sit down with them and say hey do nt take naked pic of yourself it is nt safe and someone could find them and spread them it is nt normally included with either the do nt take candy from stranger talk or the bird bee talk how about timid people who easily give into pressure sometimes people are pressured into sending nude or more seriously blackmailed into doing so
AH this is a fucking stupid post youre just arguing against everyone and when they bring up point you go umooh idunno i dont agree etc
NONE well you may call them idiot but that doesnt make them corrupt and that is what you get with religious freedom and democracy
AH i m waiting for you to cite what spewed out of your butt hour ago
NONE i m just going out now but continue this when ever your tomorrow is
AH i have no argument here this cmv is trash both the poster and the commenters this is the worst cmv i ve ever seen there is no meaningful discussion
NONE ca nt change your view i agree with you i think this is just an outdated rule that ha nt been revisited in a long time and will eventually be changed
AH you see the issue here is open border that is what wa discussed you have pretty awesome reading comprehension and went right into partisan strawman
NONE i agree people always so quick to jump the gun and get offended and for what progressivism yes because getting offended over a word is really moving u forward
AH hahahaha you think nazism had anything to do with socialism clue that they had socialist in their name wa not because they were socialist that chart is meaningless that they have a slightly higher percentage of poor people is not directly due to their being a highly socialist country france netherlands sweden denmark norway finland and even england are far more socialist than the u those socialist country contribute data to that line labeled west so while more are working more are poor holy fuck who sold you that incredibly naive fatally simplistic bullshit argument anyone with the brain god gave to shellfish can see that there s absolutely no there there
NONE so i really do nt know where to put those people this wa specifically mentioned a a mean to change your view just saying but i would also call them uninformed because looking at the most progressive and well developed country they have consistently had a lot of political stability so these people think the system need to change but they acknowledge that our country is pretty fortunate and relatively stable that s why they are choosing to elect somebody within the current system rather than say firebombing the post office it s still a radical move but not violent or terroristic necessarily so i d disagree with the assertion that they want to burn thing down so much a shock the system
AH also saying thing like slippery slope fallacy make you sound like a tryhard dingbat especially since what you were doing wa closer to a strawman argument next time try replacing the buzzword with an original thought or two
NONE i think there s still a lot of good conversation going on here so no need to kill the thread but to be fair i think a delta is in order unless libertarian are evil did nt actually represent your previous view
AH it s a comic book are you
NONE really this changed it for you
AH of course you were stop stop with the accusatory tone if you attack my character one more time i will just stop responding you think killing and eating people is permissible if they are dumb loner stop misrepresenting my argument and please drop the accusatory tone if my brother were severely retarded nearly to the point of being a vegetable it would be merciful to kill him assuming they are is it morally permissible for them to treat you that way pretty much if by the standard of the alien specie we are considered only slightly more intelligent than a pig we are not equal this allows farming we do nt need to kill them for resource irrelevant there are human that are a smart a these animal a dumb a these animal and very rarely it would be merciful to kill said human lesser intelligence is not a good enough reason to kill unnecessarily i disagree
NONE well first off no matter what you eat you re killing something plant are living a well that is how human have always survived buy consuming other life second off i m assuming that you mean it s wrong to kill an animal to eat it it seems like the consuming of the meat is nt the problem it s ending the life to do so now most people would agree that killing other human to eat them is wrong human life is special to most and everyone agrees that killing plant is alright so whats the difference thought but what about bug we stomp on roach and swat fly they have thought so when you step back and look at it it s le of a cut and dry situation and more of a greyscale we all have a cut off level of intelligence below that we do nt value the life of and chicken are pretty low on that scale turkey are pretty low on that scale
AH yes there are idiot who actually believe that
NONE s i ca nt believe soneone actually said that
AH i explicitly wrote in my post that exposure would have a positive impact that is the most argumentative way of say you re right i agree with you that i ve ever seen i m not saying all men are immature and no woman is i literally only said i would feel uncomfortable with it that s cool so uh you re not saying it and i did nt say it so why are we bringing it up now before you answer my rhetorical question i only said that the individual view you expressed wa immature everyone is entitled to their own boundary expressing my level of comfort which happen to be different than yours is nt immature your first statement is true the rest are not some view are le developed from exposure to reality than others your privilege of living in a very wealthy country that is deeply concerned with hiding regular bodily function ha given you the ability to avoid exposure preventing a more mature pointofview from developing
NONE i think you d be hard pressed to say that the canadian government is currently being brutal to the first nation perhaps they re not treating them fairly nor making reparation for earlier harm but that s hardly brutal that s politics a usual many group are not treated perfectly by just about anyone i m willing to be that if you are even a vaguely normal person that you have friend who have at one point or another in their life done something shitty to someone you do nt suffer from being their friend nor are you tainted by association with them basically you re taking this one thing that wa done in a very different time with very different more and you re holding a grudge about it there s literally nothing that can change what happened in the past but you know what there s not a single politician or other canadian alive today that actually took part in those atrocity you re basically holding relatively innocent people accountable for something they had nothing to do with i suggest that this is not helpful
AH iranian here you are complete wrong we never had the the intention of building nuclear bomb to begin with and i m not trying to sugarcoat it fuck your country and it politics we were never isolated except by you until you started to threaten everyone to cut off their heroin supply or whatever that is the cesspool of your country export to eu zone and japan that they had to cut u off and yeah it worked in a way that we re playing you like retard we re getting our frozen asset back we re getting your dumb retarded population to shift it view towards israel and realize what sort of rabid dog they are and we re totally getting our groove back by fucking miss america in the as so fuck off will ya and if you re wondering who the next iranian president will be it s probably someone like me a person who s aware of how heinous racist and retarded you westerner are
NONE i think the part that you re missing is that being a black person in america is not like being a white person in america if you account for other factor income level education etc it s harder to be black even though we ve outlawed legal segregation racial bias still exists and a lot of white people do nt want to talk about it or even consider that we might be contributing to the problem not because we re personally responsible for the thing that happened in the past but because our fellow human being are telling u that they re having serious problem now and a lot of u are nt listening or trying to see thing from their point of view instead all they hear is hey our ancestor were persecuted too get over it i disagree with op s view that we re all evil and lack empathy but i can definitely see how he a a black person living in the us would have come to think so
AH skrewup you degenerate screwup spell correctly
NONE more often than naught more often then not ಠಠ
AH this might just be the stupidest thing i ve ever read
NONE i d gild you if i could afford it this is perfect
AH you know i look at that and all i see is i m going to be a condescending jerk because i m too brainwashed to imagine any other possibility than what i ve been taught
NONE i did nt even know that wa a thing how do i do it i usually just browse this subreddit to listen to some interesting argument but i m generally a lurker
AH routinely violates the basic human right of palestinian in gaza you mean the moment when hamas fire rocket from hospital and school yeah please stop pretending that you care about palestinian human right you do nt give a fuck i know your kind too well because i grew up with them you only care about them a much a you using them a your rhetoric for your political agenda that s even more disgusting than plain support of terrorism we have arabic israeli citizen who live in affluence and safety compared to palestinian arab who live in constant fear of hamas and fatah s power grab and terrorist regime which side win
NONE more or le it s the moral thing to do they have the iron dome protecting them and hamas is nt exactly at the cutting edge of military technology the amount of casualty that israel sustains from sporadic rocket attack is minimal an end to military invasion of palestinian territory would also help at the diplomacy table and hopefully inspire fewer people to support hamas in the first place and if they continue do you think they ll ever succeed in disarming hamas do you think hamas will stop attacking for fear of their own safety they re not exactly a rational bunch of people know what i mean
AH here s my argument fuck you
NONE plebeian fuck this shit i m out
AH get over it special snowflake i ca nt stand this whiny baby generation
NONE i ca nt change your view because reading this you ve changed mine
AH you have consented you re living in a country with government which doe nt prevent you from leaving that s not consent did you read what i wrote the ability to leave doe nt create consent to contractual relationship change it or get out but do nt pretend that your childish selfishness is some kind of noble thing fuck you dude you send me of your paycheck and you can call me selfish until then you are suggesting that my labor be taken for a system that you want you can not say that a person is selfish for wanting to keep his own income while you yourself advocating for taking his income for your mean do you even logic
NONE it must come down to how you feel and it s important that you should nt feel pressured or guilty in cmv it s our job to persuade you of something but not necessarily the opposite of your view how about changing your view of the situation a if you were an outsider what if you changed your view to being the carrier of a genetic defect doe nt mean you should nt have more child perhaps in your situation you d prefer to optout and have that be a private matter but is there something stopping you from changing your view at the birdseye level do you think other people should nt have child if they carry a problematic gene
AH that s some interesting shit man and i do mean shit
NONE i like you and what you said actually make a good deal of sense
AH sound like you re a bit backwards buddy i do nt know where you re from but where i m from idle threat from stranger can get you in a lot more trouble then bad habit
NONE i think the problem here is that you re conflating everyday people with me and people i know the medium very well may be out of touch with you and your view but you do nt own normal
AH it mean he is a rapist
NONE because it is a hoax
AH i notice you still have nt responded to the other guy about whether people should disclose infertility on the first date remember not leaving a comment speaks volume none of them ever respond to that because people who use infertility a an excuse to abuse lgbt people do nt really believe what they pretend to believe about infertility it s just an excuse to be lying bigot
NONE i think we a a society need to be more open to pedophile who admit they re feeling sexually attracted to child currently it really is nt a great idea to do that in most place that said after they are guilty of molestation shame is pretty reasonable if you want to give any free will to people you have to blame them for bad behaviour thought are a slightly separate matter though
AH we are taking about clinton because that is what this specific chain is about do nt comment if you wan na have a decent conversation like the rest of u were having
NONE my problem is with the name why ca nt we have a humanism movement i want to be part of something that brings u all together not tear u apart if feminism were really about that it would have a different name
AH cmv you are a hillary shill and you should probably stop being on the internet forever
NONE sure there is there are thousand of good deal uk is just not going to get any of them
AH no there would nt have been because if no one wa there standing around a confederate statue with torch in the first place there would nt have been any conflict are you saying all of those protester are nazi ok then then i guess it s safe to say the other side composed only of anarchist rioter right the blame is solely on the nazi white supremacist etc for gathering to protect a confederate monument and promote hate there s nothing wrong with protecting any statue a for promoting hate that obviously give them good share of responsibility not for the violent behaviour of the counter protester though so yes they are clearly responsible for any violence that took place that s about a retarded nonsensical a saying that a girl walking alone in a park wearing a miniskirt is responsible for being raped if some of them got their ass beat after gathering there then good they fucking deserve that shit they are scum well you seem to be quite similar to them only polar opposite so emotionally undeveloped and irrational in general and you know what this clearly is nt leading anywhere good bye
NONE weird the last time i looked at them the people full name were pretty visible the majority of the time ken charles berger rosane t tamera b all the version i ever saw did nt have name perhaps there are some that do but that is no indication those are the actual name and simply saying they can choose to ignore it is exactly like telling a victim of verbal abuse well you have the choice to ignore it so why are you so sensitive it is a slippery slope to tell people they are being cruel by discussing an event that actually happened if the person is embarrassed by it that is really on them to accept history and move on it is also a bit different than normal verbal abuse because we are not going to these family directly and mocking them we are laughing at event far away from them it would be like an overweight person being offended that i said something against fat people that they heard second hand wa i really being cruel when i never intended that person to hear what i said like i said to me it s pretty insensitive to be a stickler here you said it wa cruel it doe nt meet the standard of cruelty
AH yea go ahead and censor me mr nazi
NONE obligatory i did nazi that coming
AH i have concluded that you are either trolling reddit or truly support sexual offender on the belief that woman being violated is in some way justified and doe not deserve protection under the law of the united state legal process
NONE so by virtue of being a crime victim my right to freedom of speech is drastically curtailed libel and slander both require that the statement be false but you re preventing crime victim from making what they believe to be true statement about the defendant
AH i m getting a little longwinded yeah you re honestly all over the place and i think if you want to do a cmv thread you need to have your thought organized and focus in on specific topic one at a time secondly i do nt mean to be rude but you are being unnecessarily verbose honestly you re pretty close to a riamverysmart behavior is complex but you ve managed to over complicate some thing behavior ha some biological basis our justice system doe nt always take this into account and is based off the idea that we need to assign blame rather than understanding the behavior itself these simple sentence capture your overly verbose comment just take a step back organize your thought and realize that you do nt necessarily need to flip through a thesaurus to explain them
NONE i think it s more that you are reacting to different thing in the music i m not a musical expert but i think a an expert you are able to focus on key detail in an otherwise ok performance that make you happy to listen while others simply do nt see the value that doe nt make them unreasonable i m much more comfortable talking about food and drink so i ll use a cocktail metaphor i might go to a bar and get a beautifully executed manhattan i appreciate the complexity of the drink and how simply balanced it is but if i go up to a random person on the street and ask them to drink it they ll find it completely unpleasant this doe nt make their standard unreasonably high or mine unreasonably low it just mean we see different thing in the same product
AH you said something exceptionally dumb were you expecting anything other than something equally dumb in response
NONE it s true that being religious is similar to being handicapped but you should nt say such rude thing in polite company
AH i appreciate you actually reading my reply unlike that poor scorned woman i wa replying to i get the impression someone seduced her with really unsmooth pua move and now she s super salty about the whole concept big shame really
NONE i ll be honest i love reddit but it s extremely liberal i ve read so many comment on how giving prisoner contaminated water is a bad thing lol another on how this lady who got an abortion bragged about it on rtwochromosomes and everyone wa comforting her pathetic
AH how about you jump in front of it yourself bitch
NONE cant you just look up all the other abortion cmv
AH i expanded on your point sweetheart you read it a disagreement because you have a chip on your shoulder only said your feeling on that particular subject were immature not that you were immature although with the way you re reacting to the word i m inclined to think you either subconsciously believe yourself to be immature or you have a deepseated fear of being seen a it your response wa in context to mine and contradictory to your response to your only other child do nt lie when it s obvious the view held by those in le developed country especially muslim one are also immature their belief are le developed because they re held back by patriarchal superstition of course that doe nothing to address my issue you re just changing the subject because you have no response perhaps my view are nt very well developed if that were the case you would probably see me acting defensive and upset a a mean of escaping the cognitive dissonance of you being inescapably right my argument would become frantic and nonsensical i would invent strawman for you to argue against because my own argument would be lacking you know kinda like you did last post and are doing now or maybe i do know what i m talking about and if you want to discredit me you re gon na have to try a little harder than a baseless implication you re the kind of person who will never admit when they re wrong fun to play with but not worth engaging with without an audience have a nice sunday
NONE do nt you worry that your life is the poorer for this not at all in fact this is the first time my thought have ever even gone in that direction so thumb up for showing me a previously unknown perspective if the people who posted homophobic crap instead kept it to themselves perhaps you and they could be friend and given that i m bi i would have been friend with people who think i should be a second class citizen or burn in hell naturally i do nt think i need those people to be my friend nor would they be if that s how they think of me and people like me perhaps your friendship might change their homophobia and either way perhaps your relationship could be good despite the political difference i do nt think i have the obligation to change their view also having witnessed the nature and ferocity of their post i came to the conclusion they belong in the not worth it category and simply removed them there s also that option where you do nt have to defriend someone you can just hide their post some political difference are more important than others and can affect relationship beyond repair is this a fair assumption i know multiple people who i consider friend and without whom my life would be poorer who can not do this have you discussed it with them have you tried to show them a different perspective in what way you are actually living a better life by posting by not stressing over thing like that by not spending time deciding whether or not i m too afraid to say what i think because someone might not like me by staying true to myself and by drawing the attention of others to issue that are important to me thus allowing them to know me better and also maybe change their view for the better a well edit a word
AH i did nt mean to attack you on a personal level but with that attitude should you really be speaking for elderly and disabled you sound like a snob to whom social security is a token of upper class stature where you provide help to the poor not out of the good of your heart but to seem generous to your friend at the boat club you want to think that developing country are of a lower level be my guest but at least under developed country help each other out of the kindness of their heart not because a authoritarian government robs you of your money and just throw it down a chute to the poor out of some misplaced sense of generosity and benevolence
NONE the ability to never misspeak or have such hollow speech that nothing can be taken out of context is not a good indicator of someone who will be a good legislator or executive in the current climate of hour news and internet fury over a mistake we are doing ourselves a disservice by keeping qualified people out of politics who are the type of people who have no skeleton in their closet or paid to cover them up and do research to figure out how people will react to every word you say only the rich and most power hungry by saying everybody ought to speak perfectly all the time we are selecting the most out of touch people to be fun our government it s really concerning actually

AH sorry my antinazi bias got in the way of your childish argument
NONE weak response i guess i ve reached the edge of your imagination
AH you say it not exaggerated like it a fact and then quote someone that say it may be a high a double without showing their reasoning you are also drawing a lot of strong conclusion without exactly explaining why especially talking about up to million people disappearing not having a terrible immediate effect on the industry that employ them and people magically moving to wherever these vacated and often seasonal job will be my point is simply dont use such strong statement unless you can back them up well also when all you do is saying everything will be better that also doe nt give you credence especially the illegal immigrant commit of murder in many state quote
NONE so someone that needed to have thing demonstrated to them in order to believe them ie show me a in the state motto of missouri but doe nt believe anything just because some other person say it would by necessity be certain that they are totally correct that seems excessive perhaps they just do nt hang out with trustworthy or particularly knowledgeable people and have learned that they always need to do their own research before believing something a long a you change your mind and do nt actually hold a certainty of your correctness that definition would seem to mean that you re not selfrighteous what doe being amenable to discussionargument changing your mind have to do with it
AH how the hell doe communism allow fulfillment if the state get to decide uhhh communism is stateless you are being confused by your owner who you believe without question the people sure a hell do nt apparently you have no clue what communism is it is an economy owned and operated by the worker everyone you obviously are owned and operated by the capitalist and their propaganda that keep you in chain there will always be some people who are only fulfilled if they can open their down business and be their own bos while i disagree with your assertion that scenario is not incompatible with communism a long a they do nt force anyone to work for them a in this economy work in the capitalist condition or die is force and they do nt steal i guess the answer ha always been to kill or imprison or re educate i guess you ca nt think for yourself you have to believe those who imprison you how many people doe your capitalist owned state kill or imprison or refuse to educate
NONE whether you believe in god or not everything that happens to you in life ca nt be calculated with cold precision at some point you will need to commit to doing something you are afraid you wo nt be able to do you will have to put your trust in something or someone you are nt sure you can trust people commonly marry and raise child and both undertaking are fraught with uncertainty a religious background can help people take on thing that are larger and more complicated than they are capable of understanding younger people are often dismayed when they discover they were raised by people who are apparently delusional they become like plato searching for the wisest of all men the truth is no one ha all the answer everyone is winging it to some extent the ability to wing it is a very useful skill it s not inherently harmful for people to believe in a benevolent god whether he exists or not but for younger people it look like a dead end because it clearly end in a state of uncertainty but everything else doe to it s just not a easy to see this make the world interesting to live in
AH nope it s always a flaw in reasoning http yourlogicalfallacyiscomslipperyslope my principle also is nt you can do violence to others whose position disagree with yours i actually stated my principle very cleanly violence in order to percent a genocidal ideology from gaining power is justified go from that principle to i can punch your every day conservative who want lower tax secondly you have reading comprehension problem that doe nt say hitler wa trying to stop a genocide it say he wa trying to stop marxist from gaining power
NONE it seems to me like you are sort of dancing around answering his question so i have what i believe to be a clearer question i do nt believe this it is just an example to establish a dialogue what if it were revealed that mixed race people were more likely to commit violent crime and because of that somebody held the opinion i do nt think different race should have child together it too risky with what we know doe this opinion marginalize people yes it doe but it is also valid rational and logically supported would you respect this opinion
AH a i do nt buy the narrative that islam is carrying out an invasion of mainland europe that would require the religion not even the culture to have some kind of unifying plan which you just do nt see sound to me like someone is unfamiliar with the doctrine of islam and ha nt been paying attention to world event nor to past year of jihad conquest b the leaveremain question is difficult and multifaceted and if your only reason for wanting to leave is the perception that you ll have better control of the border that suggests that it is a shortsighted measure which is not appropriate for such a long term issue wanting to control border is shortsighted do you know anything of history how stupid can you be
NONE the harm is not necessarily because they are religious but because they are often totalitarian and exclusionary especially in the case that there are many different form of the institution resulting that your whole life can be lived within the confines of this group then may i suggest that your view shift it focus on religion into this i believe the government ha a responsibility to network and expose child to multiple view and supportive community is far more universally applicable this is basically what public education is after all just a mandatory version of it singling out religion creates a contradiction if this is your reason then you should want the same for all situation that it applies to religion should nt have anything to do with it
AH there s nothing wrong with someone s health when they re bound to a chair against their will there s nothing wrong with someone s health when they re stolen from and dealing with them doe not involve a guaranteed death so that are not comparable you re acting like this is nt a life altering event no i m not i m saying you ca nt kill the fetus under what circumstance do you think someone should be allowed to seek medical attention elective abortion are not medical attention anymore than botox injection an ovum is in the present an ovum is a cell it will always be a cell until other stimulus affect it it is like not a zygote which will slowly make a human given no external stimulus you need to meaningfully distinguish between future people that are ok to prevent and future human are are not ok to prevent there are no future people that are okay to prevent where did you get that also judging a being s value on it future seems to suggest that the deathbed murder i mentioned earlier would be ok i never weighed the value of human future they all hold the same intrinsic value by existing that is not for human to determine the fact is every potential future person need something in the present to ensure they are a person in the future oh my god are you actually retarded that is exactly my point i m saying there is morally no distinction than between a zygote and an adult the fact that they all need something to survive makes that point
NONE so is your mind changed you did not make this exception in op i suppose i did nt think of these exception in my op so in that sense yeah but i would nt call this a complete change of mind it s uncommon to see a complete change here i will take it please see comment rule in sidebar you keep saying it but provide nosupport why should a county have to deal with it criminal they have a hereditary entitlement to living there since their ancestor still contributed to the country it s unfair but it s the same principle a inheriting a big sum of money from your parent you did nt work for it or particularly merited it it just happened that your parent were rich why is hereditary right le revocable than residence right given to immigrant you propose a change in law a long a we are changing law why not do it right it s more than a change in law it s a deep change in mentality which is needed no one care about repeat offender criminal i am sure there is a much support for my rule a for your immigrant rule no one you have let them in and gave them residency they have a right to be there you ca nt just evict them randomly they have a right to be there a long a they honor their part of the contract if they do nt nothing force the country to still respect it part why should not this reasoning apply to hereditary right you have right a long you honor your part of the contract and do nt break law

NONE look at how any non feminist is reacted to on college campus look at how microaggressions moved into the norm it wa originally only in group that agreed when they make these argument it becuse these are the issue that will be pushed in a few year and they are getting in lockstep for it so when it roll out people see out of nowhere all these people shaming others look at the latinx term did you even question it it from a language that is gendered yet they degendered it without baiting an eye you need a group just barely large enough to shame others
AH it s not like i m some pro at waiting table maybe you just suck making hr is nt that much for waiting table raise your standard god damn

NONE until they are in a public situation where she s getting teased or someone s behaving insultingly with either of them that s when the guy is expected to take over and intimidate the other person or defend their right if the guy is unable to do so then the girl would lose respect for him if someone is teasing me in the public i ignore them i would lose respect for the man if he reacted such people arent worth any reaction if they tried to get physical well i carry my own gun and can use it just a well a my bf tell me honestly which question appears smarter showing you didnt know is not wrong no one know everything it show you are genuinely interested though while the other option might look like you are up for an argument do nt understand why girl would feel le safe around such people people can lose their temper all of u do sometimes and he might be totally into you now but what about year after marriage what about your kid wont he overreact and beat them

NONE animal feel pain and have experience so what who care like seriously if you genuinely think that killing a plant and killing a cow are similarly a bad then you just have nt thought about it do nt be dismissive and do nt be distracted my point is to state that your definition of violence ha not been established you have no basis to dismiss anyone questioning it proof
AH how am i wrong you know it s ok to admit someone else is right right
NONE sorry i m a little confused what is your view now ha it changed
AH a knife is also designed to destroy if you want to really extrapolate this retarded argument you re trying to support

AH oh so you re just a racist that s boring
NONE well that s just like your opinion man
AH there are dangerously stupid idea based in disgustingly selfish willfully ignorance ruling our country because people like yourself have utterly insanely decided to tolerate those who promote antiquated immoral idealogies i am proudly a bigot towards those who espouse hatred based in willful ignorance and reverence for naked lie everyone should be you should be ashamed grow a spine and realize not every idea is ok and some people are never going to agree with you and they will walk all over you and our country and culture if you never say enough is enough
NONE since you like pithy expression have you ever heard this one love the sinner but hate the sin it s one thing to try to have sympathy for bigoted people but tolerating bigoted behavior is counterproductive if you are trying to make the world more tolerant if there s some guy always telling racist joke at work and you put up with it because you want to be tolerant then you are actually helping make the problem worse by encouraging a hostile workplace environment rather than practicing tolerance you are enabling intolerance
AH typical white person view i love how you re all so intimidated by equality get over it supremacist
NONE yeah i totally agree with you op been trying to figure out how to articulate this idea for a while now
AH nah that s sexism it s just that i m a guy and well it s misdirected but i ll take a hit for a good cause if it make you look like an idiot

AH except it did nt say that these strawman are getting are getting old how do you not realize how similar death by caffeine and coffee will kill you are you re being willfully obtuse so you say cite something i do you claim it is clickbait i show you what the article itself is getting it info from you say no thanks i asked for you to cite some actual evidence not a blog then you told me to read a textbook citing a source is a easy a this http ajeoxfordjournalsorgcontentearlyajekwsabstract that s called science it s only article of many so it doe nt prove anything necessarily but it s better than a blog trying to sell you thing
NONE i m going to try and start from the beginning on this point fundimentally the issue is nt veganism it s about social interaction when you start telling people about veganism and about why they have to eat what you think they have to eat a far a the person you are talking to is concerned you ve started a debate with them a debate they do nt want to have with you right now the argument i do nt tell you what to eat so do nt tell me is more accurately phrased i do nt start fight with you about what i believe so do nt do the same to me in essence the disagreement is social not ideological the person ha phrased it in an ideological term to make it more potent but the fundamental principle is social

NONE after that once is it okay to never again question that belief i know it s nit picking but the only flaw i can find in your argument i m on the second bottle of wine sorry edit i ve got ta say i agree i think any belief an individual ha that they consider important to them on any topic political moral social or whatever they should question them just that it is to much to say never if your cmv wa i believe that you should actively question any belief you hold where a differing opinion exists or something like that i do nt think i could honestly think of a counter point that is nt quiblling over definition although to be fair that is just what i ve done here solid argument there dude karl popper for the win
AH can you also use google here you go http wwwhuffingtonpostcomhousingfirsthomelesscharlottenhtml

AH while the other analogy he provided did nt go a well but it would be similar to being afraid of being attacked by a shark while in the ocean there is certainly a possibility of being attacked by a shark but the chance of getting attacked are so low that it would be irrational to be afraid of it whenever you re in the ocean it wouldnt be if there were current policy in place to import shark from the most violent shark water on the planet to the coast of the usa you are a terminal fool lmao
NONE i m a little late on posting this but one thing to keep in mind is that superman is capable of stopping a large amount of event that could also end humanity taken together those event may actually represent a greater extinction threat than superman himself he could stop meteor collect resource like water from asteroid or other planet if there wa a shortage prevent human from destroying the world and deter a nuclear warhead straight out of the sky i m sure there are many others i m not even thinking of

AH just charge more who should charge more the hair stylist they do nt have the option unless they go into business for themselves the owner why so they can give their employee a bigger percentage pull in le business and make le themselves how are they going to charge when you can get an equivalent haircut down the street for some diehard customer might stick with you but most people are going to go with the most economical option for their price range and for what so you can make some ridiculous point about tipping what because one of your employee is mad they got stiffed once in a while of course not it s the same price but your version involves a whole lot of drama just tip it s not hard i make like k a year and i tip my hair dresser quit being a cheap bastard
NONE oh i get it it s psychological a bonus feel different from saving but a i said it s distorted thinking because you re treating some kind of money a different from other kind even though it really all amount to the same thing if the only way you can justify a purchase is by tricking yourself about how you paid for it then you probably are nt weighing your cost correctly in the first place the fact is if you buy a bed with bonus but could have instead invested that to make say then you re really paid for the same exact product psychologically you might feel better but you actually just chucked a bill into the trash can in truth you re in a worse position to buy the bed no matter how you feel about the situation at today s price that s tank of gas for my little car i ca nt speak for anybody else but l would be happy to take a couple free fillups if they were offered
AH i made argument you failed to understand them and you misinterpreted them to a point where i think you did it on purpose you think putting an oceanography class on your resume is a supplement for lax course in your major thats what you said lmao also the fact that liberal art major struggle to find work is not a secret since you cant even accept that reality there no point engaging you who do you think you are denying this fact who do you think you are that you can hold your nose and go source please on a problem that is so ingrained into american society it like saying source please when someone talk about the race issue in america the conversation op started ha been going on for year and youre just going to sit here and say liberal art major have the same job prospect a stem major okay buddy i cant talk about the employment disparity between college grad with liberal art degree v those those in health it econ business stem with someone who refuse to acknowledge it existence and no it not my responsibility to educate you or convince you this disparity exists just like it not my responsibility to convince you that other social disparity that exist im leaving for real this time i just had to knock you off that pedestal because you insinuated you were somehow better than me because of a lack of humanities course hounding me about specific is a way for you to punt the point down the road oh he ca nt literally prove liberal art major struggle to find work compared to others guess it doesnt exist prick
NONE even if i do nt support the kid s argument i do nt think the professor in that scenario should say his argument is wrong the professor should definitely say that personal attack will not be tolerated because that s clearly a targeted attack the kid would have been asked to leave class at my school in a debate or discussion you are free to state your opinion but you should never target someone the classroom should be an environment of respect but it doesnt fall under the idea of safe space because people are allowed to say an opinion that may offend you i dont think it s wrong for the kid to say black people commit crime and overexaggerate police brutality it s a more general statement a it s not targeting a specific person in the classroom yes it s a hurtful statement but it s also the perfect opportunity to open discussion and share your side of the argument that may be what they genuinely believe but you could change their mind and if not them then the people who are listening i ll admit that i am ignorant to how certain social issue affect people but i love learning by listening to discussion in classroom because the kid make that statement he created a discussion and someone like me would be able to listen to the side i m ignorant to and learn about it if he had nt i would nt hear about it it would be silenced if the classroom is a safe space it like this subreddit in a way everyone come in with different opinion and is free to state them but if you personally attack a specific user your comment is deleted

AH okay we ll go through this again a second time with your post i think you should stop being rude you sound like a teenager jumping on the first thing you do nt agree with already presuming the other person is more or le hostile unless youre eyesight is poor i said i m interested in hearing another side not interested in being berated it s not a hard concept to grasp before i made this thread i personally already agreed with the consensus of the commenters in this thread i didnt think there wa anything wrong with monsanto i knew the hype around this corporation wa just that hype unjustified blanket hate full of urban legend and myth if you will with most people listening to the hive mind against monsantos practice without fact checking half of the thing i ve posted are copy pasted from friend argument i knew they were bull but i did nt know why and my work schedule extremely restricts the usage of my time so here i am posing a one of them to get better information than i would have been able to search for you re in the wrong type of sub reedit if you re looking to belittle people with your original holier than thou approach that got deleted a it should have go away i do nt want you on my thread
NONE well there are few thing in this world i feel certain of but one of them is this love is a crapshoot it take about a billion and twelve random chance for two people to meet to actually see something in each other even if it is there to be willing to admit it and then to be in any kind of life circumstance to start a relationship of course nobody like the thought of that and it s not just pickup artist who believe themselves in control lot of society believe that it s somehow your fault if you ca nt find someone the statistic god do nt care though if you want to believe otherwise go ahead i tend to doubt it make people happier in the long run a solid chunk of pua s really did earn that image and for a reason but i wo nt stop you that being said i for one would find it offputting to hear i intend to be in a relationship now and either you seem like a safe enough bet or else i ve explicitly decided it s going to be with you just thought i d put that out there i m sure you d never admit a much if you believed it hiding it probably would nt go over too well either people just do nt like to think that other people are controlling them even in little way
AH lollll neckbeard doe nt like being called neckbeard niceeee complete autism and newsflash a long a the ussr had enough nuke to destroy the entire world not taking them seriously is brain dead retarded people always use the presence of an enemy to justify thing but that doesnt make them any le dangerous and you know the year after the bbc made that documentary they got bombed by alqeda and promptly shut up about this shit it pretty discredited now
NONE i still feel like the view i wanted challenged wa that there would nt be a sort of war where a bunch of robot started building copy of themselves and take over a bunch of company and start a war that is definitely less likely however if a sufficiently advanced ai decided that the best way to maximize it value function wa to kill all human like the one that is supposed to minimize human suffering that i mentioned it could potentially happen
AH nothing of what you have said is factual or true or accurate in any way i proved that conservative harm young people by throwing them out on the street in large number and that this happens because of conservative idea it s wrong and you condone it because in your view these young people are insignificant you have proven my point about the heartless and cruel nature of conservative by lying about the problem to begin with in your pathetic attempt to whitewash it and by saying that once called on your lie that it s insignificant you lied when you said it s not true and you are lying now when you say that the right of young people not to be abused by ruthless parent who are breaking the law are insignificant religious conservative parent who are throwing child out to be hurt or killed should be convicted for their crime of child abuse
NONE some people just do nt deserve to live if they are alive for the sole purpose of committing crime and other atrocity like school shooting killing mutliple people ruthlessly unempathetic people who rape and murder elderly people or young kid etc all of these people deserve to die for the barbaric and horrible act unspeakable act that human can do to each other should extremely violent psychopath and criminal not be allowed by the u to die why do we need to keep those people alive they re a waste of oxygen and a waste of tax dollar you bring up a point i m assuming this argument applies to a society where cost of keeping prisoner is insignificant this make the argument of tax and cost on society invalid and wrongfully so just to put your argument on a pedestal by ignoring this key issue you in turn remove a key arguing factor against your view all in all the death penalty should be used to punish those who endanger other people s innocent life especially if that s all the person doe there is no cure for craziness if that s all the person care about
AH i m not bossing around anyone i m not giving any order to anyone i am sharing information with an involved party that is all you re just an asshole do you realize this
NONE oh jeebus apparently you need to explain how you view wa changed you know what i do nt need a delta to feel special changing someone s view is enough for me thanks for trying
AH i meant black life matter but obviously you are no longer arguing in good faith it got out of control the same way blm protest become violent because of a lack of policing and certain people getting violent
NONE you do nt seem to understand that where there are people in power there is always the potential for abuse and when we re talking about absolute unopposed power that risk of abuse becomes totally unacceptable
AH how about u fuckin argue with me with u fuckin shitcore opinion the only thing that djbtffn know is how ur fuckin dickcheese smell at am i actually know shit about music im trained in classical music rock the best kind of music ever created and today fucking bullshit pop music u know what they always say music is like candy u throw the rapper in trash or i this case the trap xd fuckin argue with me i want to hear ur absolutely shit and close minded opinion u subpar human ur a fuckin joke thats why get it im and i have a greater grasp on music than u ever hope to keep playin ur youtube rip of far side of the moon living thru the glory day in ur mom basement
NONE im aware of the fact that my selfworth isnt all that great and i will get somewhat irrationally jealous i never act on those feeling or bring them up and the next day ill realize how ridiculous they really are if it something that keep happening and make me uncomfortable ill end up bringing it up and see if hearing my so s side will help ease my worry or try to reach an understanding one thing i know many people say is that they wouldnt care if their so went to a strip club but i would feel pretty shitty if my so went and paid actual money to have another porbably more attractive girl flirt and dance on him i think thats disrespectful but dont judge any couple that is fine with it to each their own
AH but muh patriarcheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee go strawman someone else on request any man should be able to dispute paternity i have already replied to this argument from another commenter find and read that comment if you actually care i m not interested in a debate that start with a strawman edit changed last sentence to avoid violation of rule rule
NONE i also found it very compelling when i read it this morning wa it able to change your view in any way if so do you mind awarding a delta i d appreciate it whenever a comment cause you op or not to change your view in any way please announce it by replying with a single delta and an explanation of how your view ha been qualified modified reworded or otherwise changed
AH i m done with this facile argument
NONE fuckin a i ca nt argue with this
AH you ve got issue dude get off reddit a while and talk to some woman just in case you did nt see it the first time
NONE i wa just trying to list every negative obama point i could think of congratulation you re part of the problem
AH it lie in which of the dozen or so mathematical average you re talking about the average of nine s and one is how many of those number are below here maybe this will help elucidate the concept http wwwmathsisfuncommeanhtml if you know of any skewed unimodal distribution population do nt hesitate to impress every single last one of the scientist studying demographic in the history of the human race swampdonkey is a sexist insult it s pretty ironic that you re calling someone bigoted while being a bigot yourself what s sexist about it what make you think i m a bigot yep oh okay since there s nothing left otherwise you ll ostensibly stop replying but it s a good idea to have a little more than a pithy quip if you after the whole comment chain you re still not seeing an salient point then there s not much else to discus it s a democratic form of government which mean the average voter still decides the issue at least in theory but it s not it s a federal republic which mean the average voter doe not in fact decide the issue in practice or in theory and that s the whole point of this posit which is apparently falling delicately onto deaf ear caked full to the brim with sebum
NONE who s fault is the in equality then a select group of white male no one s everyone s who care why doe fault even occur to you i m never really inclined to think of it a the kind of thing that really ha anything to do with fault so i m always nonplussed when other people do even though i do nt engage in discriminatory behavior i discriminate merely because i exist and am given preference over others for being white and male that s the entire idea of white privilege no the entire idea of white privilege is that it is not necessarily anyone s fault for benefiting it s not something you stole and thus deserve blame for it s something you were just born with in the society that s the whole point so i am really curious where you got the idea that white privilege wa about telling white people they discriminate is it possible that talking about race make you feel defensive which in turn make you interpret these idea in an unfairly accusatory way the point of these issue is to point out unfairness and inequality it doe nt matter whose fault it is the point is that everyone white or not ha a moral obligation to do what they can to make thing more fair because fairness is a better state of affair
AH since you seem to be struggling with reading comprehension i ll pull direct quote woman may also refer to a person s gender identity instead of their sex female ♀ is the sex of an organism or a part of an organism that produce nonmobile ovum egg cell and while we re on the subject saying something doe nt make it true i could say right now that you re a cactus but it wo nt magically make you transform no one is saying that this is right we re saying that it exists right now in our society the word woman carry with it a ton of thing that are not biological saying that those thing will go away once the word doe is like saying that we can get rid of racism if we just erase any mention of race
NONE i think you re interpreting what they mean a little too strictly there s a usage of pride that is essentially an affirmation that you do not feel it opposite shame so when you see a gay pride parade interpret this a an i do nt feel shame about being gay parade and it will make more sense the reason this is done is because a you re obviously aware there is a sizable portion of the population that tell them they should be ashamed for this so the parade are a way of casting off that image that people try to force upon them saying you try to tell people that what we are is shameful but we re here to show everyone that they do nt need to accept this shame consider it definition b a reasonable level of selfrespect http wwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarypride
AH denying a child the right to a better life and sentencing her death basically help thing how it make arrogant whiner like uyoucanthandlethelie feel better because child are being murdered for their principle of sentencing all refugee to death rather than allowing anyone to take the easy way out because the only way to stop murderous regime from slaughtering child is to ensure they have plenty of child to slaughter in uyoucanthandlethelie s mind that somehow make sense somehow not in any way a sane human being is capable of understanding of course but it only ha to make sense to people who think raping murdering and torturing child is better than letting anyone get anything easy
NONE not necessarily all you have to do is convince them that the outcome of not having the abortion is worse than murder an analogy that come to mind is with war most people are against killing other human until it come to a need to go to war in that example people who are normally against killing people approve of killing people usually it s for the greater good now not sure what the argument would be that aborting baby murder is better than the alternative maybe the kid will have a lifetime of suffering but theoretically you can still potentially convince a person who think abortion is murder to allow an abortion
AH i m not saying that they can get married i do nt believe that they should force people to provide for their marriage ceremony jesus all of you people are so ignorant about others belief read what i m saying for god s sake i do nt care if gay people get married i already said that in a previous comment i do nt care much about gay marriage
NONE i agree with you i ve always wondered why rapist and child molester do nt have to do more time and have always thought these should be the people who should do the worst job people do nt want to do and even be front line of the military but we do nt call them hero the real soldier would refer to them a more of human bait yeah idk though
AH if it doe nt matter then why are nt the candidate provided the question in advance or said differently why are you defending that stupid mumbling stupid piece of shit dirty donna are you her dumb cousin or something
NONE and what s wrong if someone actually want to conform to gender stereotype for themselves so long a they are nt pushing it on anyone else is nt the whole idea that anyone can do whatever they want regardless of gender
AH just because you didnt realize it when you wrote it doe nt mean you did nt say it reason we do nt keep slave is because we do nt need to do nt want to and ca nt also you re a fucking cunt we do nt keep slave because it s dehumanizing and wrong not because we do nt want to or ca nt you fucking pyschopath edit also i see you re unfamiliar with starting ha to be the dumbest fucking sentence ever written i thought maybe this is nt fully idiotic and there is something more here but there wasnt i m obviously fucking aware of beginning and end my point is that it s a typed conversation and i do nt need your stupid rambling intro double edit a for the tantrum comment my original response wa short and corteous ala yoda from star war so any lack of courtesy wa out of your incessant need to continue a failing conversation that i assured you quite quickly wa off topic and would remain so this is all your own doing after that intial response
NONE i m not sure i follow your last paragraph there are many way to be politically active without being in the street protesting if you do nt like protesting do nt do it but do nt think that simply because you do nt want to go down that avenue that there are nt any other way to be active i see your point i really do i would thoroughly enjoy stranger coming to help me if my life or freedom wa in jeopardy and i did nothing wrong so if i m interpreting this correctly and let me know if i m wrong you would enjoy others coming to your aid but you do nt think they should be obligated to because it seems to me that this is sort of the end of the argument if you want other people to help you out why would nt you be willing to also stand up and help them out no one is forcing you to but it s still the right thing to do
AH armed robbery is not a business practice but instead a crime please try again
NONE since the average citizen is highly unlikely to commit a crime i would agree with you
AH of course a nigger make excuse for the nigger
NONE this is one reason casual sex is just a no for me
AH some concentration of power is unavoidable but your concentration of power is somehow better got it there is far greater transparency and oversight over political power yes i can see how well that s going with our congressional approval rating koch brother have zero accountability really starting to take you le seriously citizen united yep really really starting to take you le seriously because in many country politician are not a subgroup of millionaire we should remove the requirement from the constitution that say only millionaire can be elected to public office and just make it so that literally anyone can be they do nt care about citizen s wellbeing only the next quarterly report everything you re saying is just starting to sound like you ve copied down the sign you saw at your latest student rally on the quad
NONE a consensus in science it is impossible to ever be sure of something they re never will be anything to that extent consensus on global warming caused by human activity is more than enough why believe the instead of the where is the evidence that give u reason to believe it s caused by u everywhere google it here is one http wwwucsusaorgglobalwarmingscienceandimpactssciencehumancontributiontogwfaqhtml how do we know this is nt a scam concocted by the government and scientist are nt just buying into it for funding common sense just think about what is more likely a massive underground agreement between every scientist in the world which not one person ha been able to figure out yet or maybe there just is nt i think we should be more sure of the claim before we start crippling our economy and giving more power and money to the government what exactly do you need to be sure of it
AH regardless can you provide a source saying that the big bang theory and evolution by natural selection are intertwined nope that d take me too much time it s long buried by now i am demonstrating to you that we do not need the original scientist who first came up with the idea to expand on it plus that is exactly what you did above earlier you said so who s talking in anecdote it seems like you are the one unfamiliar with the scientific process provide a source for your claim or we re done with this conversation that s cute well i guess if you re so kind to lay it out so neatly case closed dude i am not in this sub to learn nonsense
NONE shaman know their stuff they have practiced shamanism for year look if we make science secret we create an aura of magic around it and once people believe magic what s to stop them from believing other magic the best thing about science is complte transparency any experiment can be verified by anyone there are no secret also it seems like you changed your view in your op you qanted to keep public completely in dark now you want to pick and choose bit and piece that are revealed while the rest is kept secret that is a be view also you do nt explain how we would decide what to revealand what to keep secret seems messy
AH i would ve been asleep hour ago the thread died before you brought this up i disagree with any subjective reasoning which concludes the amount of good in the world outweighs the bad even the most generous hypothetical measure comparing the two can not come to that conclusion how many wedding night would it take to cancel out someone being tortured and killed how many christmas to make up for a child being raped if you can live believing that the world is a good place then i advise you do so instead of asking me to burst that bubble
NONE i kind of get the feeling that the goalpost have been moving in your head without you being aware of it maybe even before you wrote out this post take a step back and analyze what this view actually mean imo it not much more useful than saying that if unicorn exist then we should be able to domesticate them why doe it matter if we should be able to domesticate unicorn when they do nt exist is it possible that you started at that conclusion of suicide being absolutely justifiable first and then looked for the justification after that
AH thats a dumb and ignorant a saying good luck in year when california and texas decide to leave you
NONE finally a comment that doe nt boil down to i hate trump and think he s an idiot an bad for america but
AH it s not part of britain they say it ireland say it your an idiot someone will kill you if you say that in the republic you do know a republic is an individual state
NONE it s more palatable yes but still a shame suffering is unfortunate and the ideal to me is to have a little of it in our life a we can manage no matter who it happening to
AH seriously i look at your username and all i know about you is that you re probably a person who belief that there are more than two gender not making a value judgement here just a statement about your interest what s wrong with that maybe consider writing it that way next time the idea that there are more than two gender is particulary widespread among people that some might call sjws the use of the term sjw is particularly widespread among people that some might call misogynistic manbabies not making a value judgment here if being a misogynistic manbaby work for you and make you happy more power to you
NONE are there actual boundary that i can not overcome due to my skin color that s not so much what the racism we re talking about look like anymore there do still exist people who are overtly racist but the you are race and therefore you can not whatever is mostly out of our institution thank goodness that doe nt mean racism is over though what we mostly talk about is systemic probabilistic thing for example if you send out two resume that are identical except one ha the first name john and the other ha the first name jamal john is more likely to get a response it s not a huge effect but it s real
AH you do nt modify your car to be fast and loud to be an asshole of course you do nt but it doe nt change the fact that you are an asshole you do nt have to try on purpose to be an as it can be unintended or something that you re not aware of maybe this video http wwwyoutubecomwatch vyvteoaqy will help you but it probably wo nt because you re an asshole
NONE could it i honestly would nt know well it doe it may be hard to see if you have nt experienced it but it happens very often and not just in romantic relationship i guess your view is limited by your experience which simply mean that it ll become le accurate a you meet more people for now you should probably accept the word s of the many people who ve tried to convince you to change your view

NONE your view ha nothing to do with reddit you want to debate against liberalism and are using reddit a your excuse so that your attempt at soapboxing is nt too blatant
AH are you really stating that an adult can have a healthy sexual relationship with a year old are you objectively stating this or is the fact that you re a pedofile influencing that statement you just stated that kid can do thing if they perceive them to be good without those activity actually being good for the child would you let a nine year old negotiate the sale of a house because that could be fun and educational too
NONE maybe i used a bad example with the parentchild relationship pretend you have two coworker who always buy lottery ticket one day one win the other complains incessantly that it s not fair that they did nt win this would be a legitimate time to tell someone that life is nt always fair this coworker is an adult so you are under no obligation to deliver a teaching moment you are just trying to point out that their complaint is illegitimate
AH so you say that no god equal to no meaning if your life is so full of meaning why are you a druggie that s the christian way that s why god bestowed you with your psychiatric problem i find your post offensive towards atheist that s why it may seem i m coming on too hard what would you say if i were to tell you that i believe religious people are more prone to be killer than atheist or homosexual are inclined to be pedophile you re just an asshole and this subreddit is too civilized to tell you that but i m not
NONE so how would you combat this put everyone in reeducation camp like the chinese did after wwii make everyone think and act the same if you believe people to be intellectually inferior for believing in god that s your prerogative but think about it this way your intelligence will be diminished by their enlightenment of what you think to be true you ca nt have smart people without stupid people that s why i have no problem with people not understanding math or economics it s something i just am better at and that for better or worse make me feel good

NONE having a bad memory is most often genetic a result of physical trauma or the result of a disorderillness it rarely ha anything to do with how much you care about something for those who have these reason for bad memory you being angry for them not remembering thing and saying they do not care is the equivalent of being angry at a leg amputee and saying they are lazy for not running
AH it wa a side note that obviously hit a nerve welcome to the internet kiddo and you again ignore the actual content of my word and resort to an ad hominem why do nt you just crawl back to whatever echo chamber you emerged from you obviously have no idea how to hold a proper discussion why are you even on this sub the whole point of this sub is to have a decent back and forth of idea not make ad hominems
NONE you can put in a tin box next to the toaster though and that s nearly a good while i m here i ve noticed a small discrepancy in the content of your current post and that of your op it seem you support ubi which would be a direct contradiction to libertarian thought how is that you can hold that view and still maintain that liberstarianism is the one true political philosophy that literally everyone should follow
AH what the fuck is wrong with you you want a new generation crippled with loan just because you were how doe a new grad paying loan or not affect you give me one good reason why that matter besides not hurting your precious feeling

NONE please do nt take this the wrong way but there is nothing in what you posted that would make me think you would succeed in college you re going to encounter the same boring class or assignment you re going to have to deal with all of the stuff that right now you do nt deal with all that well you ca nt just turn thing on and off like a switch you re forming habit and those habit will be very hard to break if you continue to place zero effort in your schooling it doe nt really matter if you want to help the world or not your future job will probably not reflect your level of ability
AH please do nt spout off about my ignorance of depression i went to medical school i ve had extensive training in psychiatric disorder and their treatment and a a doctor this directly affect my work and my patient that s funny because i ve seen plenty of healthcare professional doctor therapist physciatrists and they re all dogshit cunt who care more about their paycheck please do nt bring your own qualification into a debate it just make you look like more of an as especially how in your other post you think depression is a mild phase
NONE if i can bring up something there s a thing called gatekeeping that is done by many many medical professional in regard to this there are doctor that try to artificially stretch the time it take for you to get on hrt that will require you to live a year full time a your target gender before even considering giving you hormone etc those professional are actually doing the opposite of encouraging transition and do so due to own bias good luck getting treatment year ago if you were a trans woman and lesbian and outdated practice
AH yes clinton wa awful for intervening to stop dictator and for not intervening to stop dictator she should have done more to encourage election in those place and she should have done le her policy towards the middle east is not a aggressive a trump and it is also more hawkish we should welcome with open arm latin refugee and also build a giant wall to keep them out we should treat the life of nonamericans the same a the life of american and we should also impose trade restriction on other country you are upset if a single hospital get accidentally bombed but cool with making the murder of noncombatants official state policy if clinton pee she should have taken a dump if clinton take a dump she should have just peed your view is that clinton s foreign policy is worse than trump s regardless of what either s foreign policy actually is you realize clinton would be much better for domestic affair so you re only shot at rationalizing your desire to pout over your first choice losing instead of voting for the right person is to do mental gymnastics into saying clinton would be far worse for foreign issue
NONE if obama had broken this particular protocol in the exact same way he would have been praised by democrat a a bridgebuilder and champion of national selfdetermination willing to stand tough against chinese expansionism and republican would be complaining albeit le loudly because they know toughness is supposed to be their thing about rocking the boat if obama had done it it would have been after vetting the idea with the state department and an extremely lengthy internal deliberation with and among his foreign policy advisor breaking foreign policy precedent can be a destabilizing move and is one that should be approached carefully and deliberately trump on the other hand broke with foreign policy precedent either because he had no idea it existed he had an idea that it existed but did nt care because he doe nt feel like such thing matter and is nt prone to taking the time to explore the issue thoroughly before acting he had an idea that it existed but did nt care because there wa a financial incentive for him to break the precedent given his business dealing in taiwan none of those is a particularly good reason
AH what type of argument is that you ca nt focus on what we are talking about so you move he goal post and create an open ended question that can only go your way changing the fundamental of america where you have state who work together under a federal government into a single federal government would absolutely be a bad thing seriously take a debate class that wa an incredibly poor use of a question
NONE this is a situation where a better alternative or at least an idea of what a better alternative might look like is crucial otherwise unfair ha no meaningful context and we re only pointing out that the current situation fall short of something it the core problem is that too many people are nt smart or dedicated enough to be informed voter then that s not a problem a voting system can fix
AH maybe heshe ha a low iq
NONE ozymandius is that you
AH there s nothing worse than little bitch telling you you ve got an anger problem shit if you said that anger is a mental disability nonsense to my face i would beat the shit out of you right then and there if you recommended therapy to me without solicitation i would consider killing you i find that the people who have a big problem with anger are all the retarded little in the way people that need to be culled anyway
NONE i agree with you people need to be educated on gun safety yes it is beneficial to own it gotten to the point where you ca nt even go to a fucking nightclub without worrying about a mass shooting there s always that oh this wo nt happen to me mentality but i live an hour or two from orlando the pulse shooting really woke a bunch of my friend the fuck up
AH really find some example cause that s the stupidest thing you have said thus far the vast majority of gay people i know even here in louisiana are perfectly happy people happy to be left alone look you re a homophobe i get it just know that you re on the wrong side of history and frankly most people ca nt wait until you and yours go away either via changing your mind or just time there will always be people who dislike others for no good reason the reality is that gay people do nt affect you at all so your opinion is completely irrelevant do yourself a favor and just stop worrying about it nobody is making you engage in gay activity
NONE so i m sitting here about to lose my man card why that implies that all or most men are perverted invader of privacy who spread private photo against the will of the person who gave them the photo do nt sell all men so short i do nt think there are any statistic on this but without seeing statistic i can safely say that all or most men do nt feel that way so no you are nt the only one who realizes how fucked up that subreddit is and you do nt have to turn in your manhood because you do realize it frankly if the admitted purpose of the subreddit is to share photo of people without those people s knowledge then the subreddit should be shut down but reddit management suck in that way
AH are you a troll fuck you dude

AH the original statement is great wealth brings great responsibility n great wealth p great responsibility do you need me to spell out the rest for you again you said the original statement not me my deduction is based on your assertion by that logic your statement equated wealth and responsibility thereby all other multiple of such should also hold under logic by extrapolation of that logic little wealth still correlate to little responsibility which is what i tried to demonstrate a ludicrous with my example of the and your reading comprehension skill seems to really need work
NONE the whole point of a source ps message at the end of a comment should be to provide some kind of evidence that what you said above is in some way valid often but not exclusively some people including me use source personal so that you know that i have nt researched the topic extensively am not a guaranteed expert etc it s just another way of saying in my experience and doe nt have to be used a any kind of proof that my statement is valid it allows the reader to interpret my statement with the understanding that it s just my experience whatever they think that is worth
AH lol he wa nt trying to predict he wa responding to and predicting us policy in the middle east what the fuck are you trying to prove i do nt think that he would deny the violence is what he saying wrong though did participation by the peasantry not increase both of my point are correct which one are you referencing nice
NONE so put this way why not believe in god the problem with pascal s wager is that it s a false dichotomy the odds of picking the correct denominationinterpretation of the correct religion is infinitesimal the correct one might have died out thousand of year ago even the majority of religionsdenominations say you re damned to perdition if you do nt follow theirs specifically

AH your definition of rape is pant on head dumb say i want to have sex with some blonde chick we have consensual sex a week later i find out she swallow her gum instead of spitting it out like me i for whatever reason find that utterly disgusting and would not have sex with her had i known i bring up rape charge that is literally what you are saying you had perfectly fine consensual sex and then you learned something you do nt like about them afterward so that consensual sex is magically transformed into rape that s fucking insane that s not how rape work that might be how it work for you but thankfully you do nt get to define it you keep bringing up rape by deception but you have nt a clue what you re talking about you just think it sounds like what you re looking for you d get laughed out of court basically you ve made your own little bubble where you ve decided thing work a certain way and word mean certain thing but that s not how the world work otherwise half the people you ve slept with would be filing rape charge because i guarantee several would nt have slept with you had they known x stupid thing
NONE i made this throwaway for you because i actually did what you are thinking about guy had nt paid attention to me in high school and once i hit college i got a lot of attention but had no idea what to do about it i wa very anxious about sex i avoided getting physical with guy in fear it would lead to sex when i wa i decided to loose my virginity on a whim to a guy at a party while i wa drunk in retrospect it wa nt really great but it also wa nt really horrible i still would nt really recommend it it very temporarily lessened my anxiety but then my anxiety switched from being a virgin to not being good at sex so i just want to let you know it might not get rid of your anxiety for myself i ve learned the way to interact with the opposite gender is to go into any interaction especially flirting with no expectation just try and get to know them joke around if you get rejected it okay you learn every time when you find someone everything will happen so naturally however i ve talked to a few people about this and all of them female admitted to me that they did nt loose their virginity until at least i wo nt wish you luck because you wo nt need it
AH pagan which is european based on the actual roman event roman aka rome aka italy aka europe aka white people like are you actually this ignorant are you actually this thick that you believe the only thing white and european are christian or are you just a racist retard who chooses to ignore fact
NONE i somehow agree if you hate a person for what they ca nt change then you re sexistracisthomophobeetc and that s bad if you hate a person for what they can change you re ok that s why islamophobia on it own it s great while being racist against north african and middle eastern people is a terrible terrible thing
AH muh team sux i iz guud playr lelelelele drink bleach idiot
NONE yeah i hate work and i just wan na play lol all day every day

NONE never though it wa wrong good job me
AH at a current point in time where political correctness is everything pfffffffff but sure directly mock me excuse me i m fat the irony is too much are you going to cry because someone mocked you on the internet doe it feel like i m being childish and unfair poooor baby
NONE again with the circumcision debate i feel like people just look for thing to be up in arm about anymore can you assuming youre a circumcised male tell u what you miss about your foreskin i mean it not been there for a long time a long a you remember at this point right
AH well for starter my job doe nt support an imperialist war machine i m also typing on my phone it s pretty easy to do so clearly and competently my point is that reading a reply riddled with spelling and grammar error and generally written at a fourth grade reading level written by a jarhead is not exactly confidence building that the head injury in question do nt cause brain damage
NONE i also have an issue with this it s not the body because i have found myself attracted to transgenders before finding out they are trans the issue is with the creature itself that human at one point wa a man and know it somewhere in their brain they have those memory and can still somewhat identify a one on some level or at least that s what my brain tell me with it logic
AH i mean if you ca nt see why they consider a team with one close loss to a team in the top ten and a nonconference win over a conference champion to be clearly better than a team with a point loss in conference and a loss to an pitt team out of conference you re either being intentionally obtuse or you re incapable of basic mathematics also this because the selection committee very specifically wa established to be biased towards selecting conference champion and only selecting non conference champion under circumstance where that particular nonchampion or independent is unequivocally one of the four best team in the country is simply not found in the document you provided despite your insistence that it s there the committee s clearly stated first point is to select the best team similar their point seven say there will not be one single metric to assist the committee there s simply no evidence that conference championship are supposed to be given any special weight except for in the case of otherwise indistinguishable team if you ca nt see why people see a large gap between ohio state and penn state there s nothing that can be done to help you
NONE well that s nice to hear the team i support are hardly the biggest in the world or even the country but it s where i grew up although it is still an elite standard team granted however the simple number of fan prove that the majority of people like team with the best player that win the most trophy but there is a fundamental difference not having money make you weaker relative to those with more money but doe nt make your player any worse forcing team to play woman make them all weaker and the team objectively worse on it own just a forcing all member of a team to play in flip flop would and this would also do absolutely nothing whatsoever to change the money problem that you mention the richest team would simply buy the best or least bad woman leaving the game with exactly the same fairness towards poorer club but also lowering the standard across the board but expectation do not and often can not equal reality you may well expect woman to be able to perform physically just the same a men in your world where biology and genetic difference do nt exist but in the actual world where they very much exist those expectation mean absolutely zilch
AH i m going to assume you re just too drunk to understand what i m saying instead of being too stupid go sleep it off i also do nt give a wet fart about your own philosophy or what smart book you ve read sorry
NONE a someone who is basically terminal i hope i am able to eventually end my life if i can i m not talking about just because but when my life is too much of a burden i m in too much pain unable to take care of myself etc
AH yes keep telling yourself against all evidence that he s a fundamentally decent human being and that supporting him is nt utterly reprehensible
NONE just a thought i think that your argument is compelling if the person you are arguing with belief that the fetus is actually human life and not just the potential for human life
AH at what point can you understand that if people like me want justice served and there are no other avenue for that to happen people like me will end up killing people like you lol you d get smoked if you tried that shit i would never want to kill anyone who disagreed with my opinion but i will fuck you up if you try to physically harm me it s so funny you talk about preventing death on one hand but murder on the other i do nt think you understand justice or politics or liberalism or racial issue at all we re not even on the same wavelength intellectually so i m going to end thing here
NONE i think this is only true if your opposition to killing it is on a moral basis there are plenty of reason i do nt want to kill a cow most of which have to do with the logistics and the disgustingness of it not the morality for the same reason i do nt want to pave my street because it look really unpleasant but i do nt think that make it hypocritical to want the street paved we pay other people to do the stuff that they re willing to do and we d rather not do so i will agree if you re saying that it s hypocritical to morally oppose killing it yourself but still want to eat it but you can not want to kill a chicken for plenty of other reason
AH i disagree complaining about your last job for any amount of time is pretty unacceptable critically explaining the issue and how you would have fixed them seems perfectly legitimate and something i d want to hear from a potential employee i m not sure why you read complaining in my or the op s comment oh yeah while i m thinking about it reading and listening comprehension would also be very high on my list for desired skill for a new candidate
NONE you re not going to look back at yourself in year and say i m so glad i took an easy english class you are somewhat likely to look back in year and say i regret taking the easy way through school i obviously do nt know but i imagine this workload is nt quite a bad a you think it is stay focused on making constant progress and if that is nt enough talk to the teacher showing you ve made progress and ask for a little more time
AH what i m trying to do here is walk you into proving you have literally no idea what you re talking about when you cite statistic http enmwikipediaorgwikilgbtdemographicsoftheunitedstates at absolute beat your somewhere between xx off you like most millennial a grossly overestimate the prevalence of it it s the same thing with your absolute bogus claim that suicide is the th leading cause of death in this country you seem to just be making alternative fact to prove your claim so let s walk through the issue at hand you believe there should be a national policy dictating what employer must compensate their employee somehow you believe you have the right to dictate compensation package and that employer are not free to do so if the market requires more pto for people to do take a job then it will if instead we do what you want and toss employer ability to create compensation package aside how about we make it so every employer ha to pay everyone k annually how is that different than your proposal
NONE so in addition to having to provide the entire infrastructure to allow people to vote government should also have to bribe the very people they created those facility for that alone is insane to me besides do you want more uninformed and uninterested people deciding the course of the nation because what you re proposing here is how you do just that simple to implement effective motivation it s not simple to create the unfrastructure needed to punish or reward million of people for voting furthermore this motivation i do nt agree with the use of the word in this context but for the sake of argument i ll adopt it provides a wonderful avenue for buying vote if you think that wo nt happen i ll just invite you to look at gerrymandering and consider how easily your motivation scheme is manipulated all the same besides how on earth would you even check whether a person ha actually voted or not voting is an anonymous process so you ca nt check the ballot are you going to frisk people on their way out of the booth to see if they still have their ballot on them what about a person s right to abstain from voting
AH mate like i ve said elsewhere in the thread i m done you ve not drunk the koolaid you re treading koolaid in the red sea enjoy the echo chamber may the piranha never scent your blood in the water
NONE aah i see i m not a neuroscientist but i do nt think the brain work like that there s not one little bit of it that s you and the rest is just wiring the entirety of the electrical signal inside it are you
AH since when are political philosophy based upon fact it s about giving people what they want those are legitimate reason i ca nt resist countering you pointbypoint but i should nt have to no one belief politics is about intellect it s a popularity contest period despite it merit lot of people are opposed to nuclear power that s a reason to oppose nuclear power if you want vote you re wrong about renewable energy it s absolutely feasible to make that transition america ha more than enough unused desert to establish all of the solar and wind farm it need you re a victim of the oil and gas lobby also you re advocating fusion good luck convincing the average american that it s any different from nuclear similar to being a victim of o g if you ve never read an economic argument against the bailout you re not reading widely enough there are more than enough freemarketersnoninterventionists around the irony is that those same people would argue that wall street wa overregulated anyway so the bailout is ok anyway again you re confusing voter with people who understand economics this is a popularity contest not a scientific debate gun control please the entire world outside of republican america opposes arming civilian with assault rifle gtfo higher minimum wage this might surprise you but there is a whole wide world outside of america there are place where people are guaranteed living wage they have nt descended into anarchy all due respect i do nt find you particularly wellinformed you do nt seem to grasp the basic of electoral politics and your opinion smack of an echo chamber i do nt think you re in a position to criticise sander or any other candidate for that matter
NONE how assuming you mean school test school test are on thing that have been proven fact for many year there are local government and association making sure that curriculum is fair and unbiased and the people making the curriculum are nt all that powerful in your case the test is entirely political i m assuming it would be issued by the federal government since if it wa issued by the state government that would be unfair so whatever view the government ha that would be reflected on the test in your second point you contradict yourself these test are supposed to be pure fact right otherwise they would be biased a you said but how can people believe what they already think about plain fact about our government like how the executive branch work there is only one right answer to how the executive branch is supposed to work besides even if they do nt you are essentially eliminating a massive part of society politician appeal to their voter if no uneducated people are voter that doe two thing it make people easily able to draw a strict line defining who is and is nt educated and create prejudice based on that eliminates the need for politician to care about these demographic with the moral gain of helping uneducated people and the political gain of helping uneducated people eliminated that could have catastrophic effect what if politician want to force all uneducated people into hard labor camp uneducated people ca nt vote against it and educated people do nt care because they see uneducated people a worthless member of society sure this is a bit of a stretch but it s not too far off with what you are proposing finally with the last thing you said it s not ok that they re doing that and i m surprised they have nt been deleted they re breaking the rule of the sub
AH i really do nt need i have to think a little bit deeper but thanks for the suggestion if i want your advice i will ask you for it thanks again though
NONE nope but you need to add a little explanation delta thank you for explaining this i did nt think of it this way or something to that effect is usually enough i think
AH either you re an idiot or you have an ax to grind but in either case it s clear conversing with you is pointless good luck in your future endeavor i m out
NONE i think you re going off on a tangent are you trying to change your opinion to now include abortion a well that s a completely different topic you re talking about
AH op is an occupational therapist look at his history he s so full of shit in this thread and concerned with salary in the other thread that i m sure he s not actually looking for evidence against his view
NONE he wa also the last president to write his own speech and his involvement with hunting made him become an avid conservationist edit i actually cant find a source for that first part so but the conservation part is huge
AH bc we do nt owe you shit go back to your shithole country you fucking sandrat
NONE oi i changed your view slightly do nt make me beat that delta outta you
AH they have committed no crime and any society that would accuse them of one doe nt deserve to exist and should be erased by whatever mean necessary there is no child involved please stop making thing up a an aside those thought are absolutely entertained by rational people and you saying otherwise is purely nonsensical of course i m humanizing themn because they re humam being you really need to get a grip on reality because you have some very disturbed view there are absolutely such thing a rape fantasy you re denying reality again and it s not good there is no such thing a absolutely humanly unacceptable because what is and is nt acceptable is defined the societalcultural level and is not universal no one ha the right to not be objectified because that is not s right that can exist it make no sense and is impossible the rest of your rant about black and woman ha no bearing on this discussion are you trying an appeal to emotion maybe idk but it for sure not a logical argument finally please cite a single case of a nazi soldier being tried for their thought just one and while we re on the subject of nazi s thought of dehumanizing others based on factor they canxt control you might wan na do a little self reflecting there
NONE that s true censorship is nt the end all be all to getting rid of harmful ideology or misinformed view and taken too far it certainly can be harmful in and of itself like racism ha nt stopped being a problem just because it s now not okay to say the nword but the cmv is that censorship is almost always bad my argument is that there are ton of case where censorship is appropriate and helpful in real life and online it s hard to make a blanket statement like censorship is good or bad but i think there s a good case for it being used more to help disperse toxic group and ideology on the internet given the world today but obviously this must be done with a great deal of care and assembling together versus quietly being bigoted is the difference between a movement and a microaggression one bigoted person ca nt do that much a group of them can be extremely powerful i believe that if you are a logical individual you would believe in fact based theory regardless if there is opposing misinformation available i want to believe this too but the most recent election ha left me with some serious doubt either more people are nt a logical a i would have thought or even logical people can be misled if they are exposed to the wrong information in the wrong way and have a predisposition to want it to be true pizzagate
AH no one is criticising them for eating dog meat they re being criticised for the way they torture the dog which is the part you said to ignore so basically this whole question is moot and irrelevant good one moron op
NONE several answer ago i mentioned that you might not be asking about what is desirable and if so you are right to say it is a form of government but in that case the only thing you re arguing with is the definition of government
AH jesus christ you fucking pussy get over it what a passive whiny turd
NONE michael moore need a dick in his mouth so he stop saying stupid shit
AH shut the fuck up jethro you re probably just a dumb a this autist jesus i m tired of the fucking idiot on reddit
NONE did any of you guy actually watch it before voting it down i watched the whole leather special and it wa god awful
AH you are a troll even your own link indicate that tax on tip have to be paid if that s an income if the company doe nt take part of the tip a an income it doe not pay tax on the tip of their employee the keyword is compulsory a in gratuity
NONE you re completely missing the benefit of having le of a paper trail tax is a significant expense that can reduced by under reporting revenue you have a lot more flexibility and opportunity to do that if all of your revenue is in cash
AH lol this is such a shit post typical condescending leftist post
NONE typical liberal sissy reddit circle jerk going on in this thread
AH white culture and police they re dangerous they destroy town city country i think you might be mentally retarded
NONE i think they re an insult to transgenderism luckily there are very very few otherkin and they grow out of it like goth phase
AH getting a lil passiveaggressive there huh
NONE what s to stop me sniping troll like a badass
AH i ve tried to be very clear with my phrasing on this thread child mean child and fetus mean fetus also how have i taken this offtopic someone mentioned that through a prolife position any harm done to the fetus through drug or alcohol could be considered manslaughter i responded and addressed that saying that while i did nt agree with treating it like manslaughter that there should be some ramification for woman who damage their child s development fa and stuff like that by continuing to abuse drug and alcohol while the child is in the womb it wa an offhand comment because it s something i feel quite strongly about but it wa still related to the conversation and that s how it spiraled into the comment chain above you the person i wa replying to asserted that i had said i wanted to throw pregnant woman in jail when very clearly i had said nothing of the sort it s an expansion of the original topic i grant you but to say that i ve personally taken this conversation offtopic is just ridiculous
NONE the hit ratio may be poor but i think people can be swayed over time a a cumulative effect of many such debate i know that s what happened to me a i started life in a christian environment regular churchgoer my mother wa a sunday school teacher but in college when i started to talk to people and argue the toss i became the atheist i am now that would nt have happened without smart people engaging with me and making me see thing from a variety of angle it can happen maybe not in a eureka moment but it ha an effect you even say yourself i briefly believed in god and went on internet forum debating his existence then became a hardcore atheist is it fair to say that something in that process gradually changed your mind and that it did nt happen without the input of others i agree with you that a lot of debate on this subject is just talking without listening but it doe nt have to be that way people can be swayed
AH truth is truth reality is reality if you do nt want to live here if your selfish comfortable wasted life is all you value i ca nt help you
NONE if you can understand what rationality is i can not believe how trolllike this is going to be stop this this whining is counterproductive proof
AH do you want to have a conversation or do you want to troll
NONE you came to a debate forum and do nt want to involve logic
AH i d suggest stopping before you embarrass yourself further trust me i am considering saving myself the shame of communicating with you already this wa not discussed in fact i ve spent the majority of my time elsewhere in this thread informing people of exactly that that you are responsible for both decision your inability to clearly express your opinion is not something we really need to get into but just for a moment do you realize you ve not said anything to that effect in this thread the only other time you ve mentioned responsibility here is when you called it a morally relevant detail and suggested that i wa forgetting it in the blood example but that there wa responsibility in the trolley example thereby suggesting that you think you are responsible for a death in the trolley example but not responsible if all six are already dying also i like watching you talk about responsibility after your previous post said that whether you are responsible or not is nt even a morally relevant feature responsibility a it wa used above where you are responsible for throwing a switch but not responsible for standing still is what i wa calling arbitrary this is not a morally significant feature i suggest working on reading comprehension it ha application beyond just realizing when you ve lost an argument on reddit but that alone would likely be extraordinarily useful to you
NONE well the context is certainly important i am not going to suggest that there is never an appropriate time to ask about someone s heritage a friend or acquaintance or a coworker you regularly interact with might be totally receptive of such a question it becomes problematic in a couple of context that i can think of a when it s an early question in a conversation here the message is i noticed your skin colour and wanted to ask about it pretty abrasive especially when that skin colour is of a marginalized group b when the question is pressed if you ask someone where are you from and they say a local city but then you press them with but where are you really from you have ignored the response that they volunteered they probable know full well what you meant but chose not to answer it by pressing it you are at the very least being rude to your point about conflating different and outsider when you are talking about a historically homogenous culture like sweden to be different ethnically is by definition to be an outsider there is no question that at some point this person or their ancestor came from elsewhere by bringing attention to their difference you are reminding them of that status and by extension of any prejudice they gave a a result i hope i wa able to make some sense here apology for not reviewing this well i m currently on mobile
AH here is a source http wwwlawupennedulivefilesgelbachbailracialdiscriminationpdf pdf warning it s rather verbose but looking at it s summary of result it state given the model the point estimate suggest that there is substantial evidence of bias against black in bail setting it go on to say that texas is particularily bad and la particularily equal
NONE prostitution is legal in germany and it is certainly not much safer and much more substantial than in place where it is illegal quite the opposite in fact it ha pretty much been a blank check for exploiter and humantrafficking ring this article doe a good job of explaining all the consequence http wwwspiegeldeinternationalgermanyhumantraffickingpersistsdespitelegalityofprostitutioningermanyahtml
AH how about you reply to the whole of his comment and not just one little irrelevant detail is it because deep down you know how stupid you sound making this post and consecutive comment on the matter but you re a pathetic little bitch who want to claim that white men are the innocent victim in every situation moron
NONE you could argue that maybe for the two world war and i would be happy to help you poke hole in that argument but other than that it just show that you either want to paint socialism in a bad light and do that by trying to associate all sort of negative unrelated stuff with it or you never really thought about it
AH because the left ha chosen one over the other and thats the point of the entire post now either provide an argument to change ops mind or quit your semantics and get off cmv
NONE make it a freaking habit to go into the bios and change the default setting like the rest of the people who feel this way over typing up a word reason why you re against doing that
AH yes i want people who beat their wife and think it their religious right to to leave also islam is nt a race retard
NONE i really ca nt explain why right now but he need to be accepted for the love of tit accept him to art school
AH dude stop bugging me i do nt care what you have to say anymore because i happen to be of the opinion that you re not worth listening to and having a conversation with you ve shown me that you re racially prejudiced and i dont think it s possible to have a productive conversation with you a a result racial prejudice is nt productive in my opinion
NONE well i do nt disagree but i think that s veering into a slightly different debate if i ve convinced you that black people ca nt be racist towards white people make sense in a certain context no matter how rare that context is i do nt know what more i can do to cyv whether this definition is overused seems to me to fall out of the scope of your post
AH this is why i think you re a retard not everyone deserves to have an organ fail
NONE music is whatever you want it to be mate if you think it s brilliant then it is for you
AH tone lulz how bigoted for you to be insulted by someone with another opinion have another one wow you are soooo logical sarcasm
NONE a long a it doe nt cause harm to someone else yeah okay thanks for telling me that ending a human life is nt doing harm to someone else
AH you are clearly racist for saying that would you say the same about group that didnt consist of white people racist fuck
NONE so when you say modern feminism you re actually talking about a subset of asshole why rope the ideology into this
AH inb op posted fake post just to make u think he s a bearded male
NONE did op just award a delta to a post not relevant to his view and bounce
AH you re not going to change this plonkers mind just leave it and work on your french or start applying for irish citizenship if possible the fact is that the uk had designed itself to turn london into the superpower it is because of the eu they were creating a a country we ve almost certainly done the best out of the eu with continuous growth and seen house price sky rocket elevating the average wealth within the country ridiculously there is very little incentive for many business to stay in the uk and the swiss economy is considerably different we do nt have a plan of transition the uncertainty is real just like all other economic uncertainty and it s probably going to rely on boris johnson financial clout and negotiating skill enough for anyone to cry themselves to sleep tonight
NONE i agree defense spending need to be decreased but it ha to be done in conjunction with the rest of the free world picking u the slack the world work on the petrodollar our economy is based on oil perceived weakness lead to volatility would russia constrain itself how aggressive would china become it s a peeve of mine i m pretty sick of the touting of denmark in particular we sent more military vehicle to the balticeastern europe because of putin s ukraine adventure than many country even own someone ha got to pick of the slack i m more than irritated that folk say how wonderful denmark is how their program are this or that we could do all sort of great stuff if we only spent of our budget to defend ourselves and had other country paying
AH you could start with chance the rapper just a thought retard
NONE kevin gate i do nt get tired is the first one that come to mind
AH damn dude be gracious in defeat you asked people to cyv and they ve come up with logical historically supported argument and now you re being all passive aggressive that make you an asshole
NONE are these thing moderated in any way can i just make multiple account and award myself delta so a to pull more respect ps you re speaking to a delta awardee let s show some respect
AH so you re saying that my comment made no salient point while his did despite the whole bit about poor people can use the beach but they ca nt go to football game yeah i wa rude to him after he wa rude to me but now you re saying that i did nt make a logical point a well basically you re kicking me for telling him to fuck off at the end of a salient point but you re not doing the same thing to him for telling me suck to suck
NONE right and what i m saying is that doing the wrong thing for the right reason is still doing the wrong thing therefore stannis did nothing wrong cmv you ca nt say this for sure not until we know more about mel if it turn out she s evil then he absolutely did the wrong thing by letting her talk him in to killing his brother burning his daughter and marching his army to death the right thing to do would ve been to listen to davos
AH however i would assume again having never actually been to one that a homeless shelter would provide the requisite hygiene care resource you seem to have the impression that homeless life is all peachy a homeless woman wa recently arrested for leaving her child in her car during a job interview in your view what should she have done instead you probably assume the homeless shelter ha daycare service too why did nt she utilize those i bet she wa smoking and drinking instead of sending her kid to the daycare in the homeless shelter
NONE my husband father wa in jail on his th birthday for not paying child support how come some will be put in jail and other time the government will just take it right off their pay check also we know of a guy who doe nt have to pay a cent to any of the child he ha all with different woman because he s classified a mentally handicapped but he s fully capable of living on his own and working and paying for rent this is what seems unfair to me just deciding meh i do nt wan na pay and not having consequence edit wording
AH well it s largely the same group of people responding to you a to every time this exact same topic is posted coincidentally your argument are exactly the same that are made every time this exact same topic is posted might i suggest you simply take the conversation to a sub that already agrees with you that way you could have your little circle jerk of one without wasting everyone else s time by fooling them into thinking you re actually interested in having an honest discussion
NONE to address this point in particular life is nt always easy and even if you feel like everyone is against you you should keep pushing to achieve what you want in life the trouble is that virtually any level of difficulty can be swept aside with this line of reasoning at a certain point we re essentially just criticizing people for falling short of some hypothetical ideal with an infinite supply of hope and determination i think this is one of those scenario where we first have to examine how much we can reasonably ask of ourselves before judging others
AH have fun arguing against strawman meninist moron
NONE saying this is discrimination against drunk people
AH i did nt know you could be triggered by a lil bit of friendliness you should probably tag yourself so more people do nt assume you re a rational person
NONE please do i d like to know what you think there are a lot of people that have very strong response to this kind of thing but i think you were asking in good faith you do nt seem like a bad guy
AH not knowing basic aspect of conflict one intends to ignore should not be given that his plan for syria is to withdraw our military advisor and aid and just allow russia to win i think he doe not actually need to pay attention to development there i m going to ask if you can clarify why do you find it acceptable to make decision in a vacuum of information one creationist ha examined the evidence of both side of evolution and creationism carefully and ha decided to believe creationism i respect that person for taking the time to consider both side and make an informed decision another creationist decides not to bother to learn about evolution since he already know everything he need to he s not going to bother wasting time he already know he s right why bother listening to anyone outside his bubble would you respect such a person which person do you think i m comparing to gary johnson he thought it wa an acronym that is not acceptable there is no such acronym that sound like aleppo if he had an adequate knowledge of foreign affair he would know that he doe nt i think it s a totally reasonable way of asking honestly for clarification on an unfamiliar acronym rather than pretending to know then he should have asked what it stand for or what it s an acronym is if he fumble such an easy question and can not recover gracefully how is he going to deal with it a the president with the reputation of the country at stake and dealing with other foreign leader
NONE i m with op on this i agree it s a great movie and being able to sympathize with captain america is part of the reason why it s a great movie that doe nt make him le wrong or stark s pov le right my problem with the perspective that both side have valid argument is that we would not make an exception for any other entity if army special force just start doing stuff with impunity because the red tape interferes with their ability to do save a many people a possible then we d have to acknowledge that what they said is nt untrue but we d nonetheless never allow then to continue to act without oversight what s the difference between them and the avenger super power several do nt have power a lack of pre existing structure what about the law that apply across the board to all citizen resident etc of the usa them getting into a fight where emotion were high with little to no planning resulting in the destruction of an airport demonstrates that their judgment ca nt be trusted nobody would ever want a general to lead with his gut or act on a hunch when they had several super genius dude to help them come up with a plan why let captain america do it they ca nt be trusted not to destroy billion of dollar worth of stuff when they do nt need to i agree sometimes them acting save life but in our society that s not enough of a reason to act with impunity nobody else anywhere would be given an exception for this why would we do it for the avenger
AH terrorism is a big deal anywhere wtf is wrong with you just because one of those ten people is nt close to you doe nt make it le severe is the ban shit yes
NONE like i said they do eventually get it it just take a lot longer than is reasonable when you can just wait a couple year and it ll just click without a problem
AH you would have fought for franco the politicallycorrect dictator in the spanish civil war lol jk you would nt have fought for anyone because you re a coward afraid to even think or be an individual
NONE i agree if no one had ever tried to help minority in the history of the usa and we still had slavery today there would be no reason for white nationalist to be angry about anything and they would nt be making violent protest
AH this doe nt violate rule and you have no right to make assumption on my behalf simply because you do nt like the post or comment screw you
NONE so in other word you agree that your original view is incorrect and you have changed your view to i wish i did nt have to wait so long for my food
AH i would say the same about your idiotic reply
NONE wait what i m supposed to change your opinion
AH you did nt like his reply when the main comment is the insane gibbering of someone out to spread an agenda ok

NONE there is nothing wrong with it i have my preference in what i like physiologically in a girl and so do most people though i will say that personality doe play a bigger role than look there is even a front page article about it i have experienced it myself after working or having class with a girl who did nt fit my type but her personality somehow made her better look so i think you are doing yourself a great disservice if you limit yourself to girl that only meet your physical standard one more thing i think what upset a lot of guy at least is the double standard when it come to dating profile it is socially acceptable for woman to put no short guy or even please no tiny cock while men are often called pig for saying no fat girl and i could only imagine the outrage if they said no flat chested chick either all of that should be acceptable or none of it

AH management would be elected instead of appointed every workerowner in the company would own an equal share of the company management is already elected by the board the board is elected by the shareholder giving everyone an equal share would never work those who generate more value would nt have any reason to stay those who generate le value would have to be forced out you would basically end up in a situation of mediocrity of course the people who really know how to be productive could band together and keep out the low productivity people i suppose but that doe nt sound like the result you are looking for in smaller business decision could be made by directlydemocratic council in larger organization representative could be elected instead these representative would be able to be recalled and replaced at any time any business getting run by that kind of setup is going to suck they will get crushed by any competitor that doe nt use such a silly process worker would decide how to allocate profit from the company they could set aside portion to save invest or split among all of the workerowners in this case you are nt talking about worker but owner and this is already how it work there is nothing stopping you from doing this yourself of course if you try silly stuff like this you will get crushed by the competition that doe nt limit themselves to doing insanely moronic thing
NONE so from what i can gather from your op the only reason you actually think this is a good idea is because it will increase the total gdp there s a big problem with this though ignoring muh freedom which is a fairly obvious argument you ca nt assume that every business will actually benefit from this because you are not properly comparing profit in the current system vs profit under your new one for instance suppose we set up the nopainting rule to prohibit doityourself people from painting their own property how do you know they re all going to hire painter instead what if they just decide not to have the thing painted at all you seemed to assume the demand here wa inelastic meaning that people basically have to have it regardless of an increase in cost this might be true for certain good but not many service and most of the service we actually need already require contacting trained professional so there would nt be much difference there for the rest i do nt see people opting to pay extrago out of the way to get these service done in fact it s more likely that painter would just get worked harder instead of more people becoming licensed painter because of the vast amount of service that would be nonessential and probably just avoided in the event doityourself becomes illegal i think the belief that this policy will increase the gdp is totally unfounded and based on only a superficial understanding of economics
AH of course not it s not even really about that op just want a convenient way to out trans people

NONE doe it really matter if someone benefit i mean to go straight to hyperbole on the comparison i can complain about what isi without thinking it will change anything even though their action do benefit someone specifically them and i think it depends on the restaurant i ve bartended and would certainly pas along if a recent price hike wa nt sitting well also you did nt address telling friend i can change their behavior before they are locked into going to the restaurant by other factor so essentially by telling them i might be voting with their wallet

AH i have an honest and earnest question for those commenting here read mod please do nt delete this why doe reddit seem to have such a peculiar obsession with the topic of the moral and ethic of male circumcision i am a fairly active consumer of news and pop culture on the internet and this is the only place i see this issue regularly brought up let alone brought up with such passion and vitriol fempire troll spinning up year old edgelord atheist virgin about how mommy and daddy s religion robbed them of sexual pleasure in men right forum to discredit men right a a movement the other half is a mixture of joe rogan fan and people who do nt like jew edit per moderator request explaining the use and meaning of the label applied in my statement above fempire a collection of subreddits known for on and offsite coordination of political agenda initiative troll the general description for people who adopt position for reason of the reaction those position will produce in an audience rather than due to genuine belief spinning up the act of rabble rousing edgelord atheist a description implying redditors with little or no appreciation for religion and much for their own inexperienced view and opinion year old virgin a description implying redditors of limited sexual awareness so a to be particularly susceptible to being fooled about sexual matter i think that cover all the label that might trigger someone and certainly that s not my intention i m just calling them like i see them and i mean no personal offense to anyone
NONE the most important thing to note is that third wave feminism cover a wide variety of issue and you rarely get to see the one that benefit men online people like to point to the more outlandish one like the manspreading stuff you mention but forget to aknowledge that there are many third wave feminist who are actively in favor of men s issue it is very easy to get the impression that modern feminism is just manhating because these negative representation get a lot of traction on social medium and reddit while the positive example do nt for instance take clarice thorn http clarissethorncom who ha written a great piece about why men do nt deserve to be called creep http clarissethorncommendontdeservethewordcreep while that is just one example one big focus of third wave feminism is also about criticizing gender role which also includes the expectation set towards men do you loathe being expected to pay on date always having to be stoic always being the initiator or having to put all of your time into your career in order to make more and more money because not doing any of those get you derided for being le of a man feminism is against these standard being pushed on people and while they do a lot of work talking about this stuff happening to woman you also have a lot of feminist talking about men s problem if you want to learn more about what feminism is doing for men you can find a very extensive collection of link here http wwwredditcomrmenslibcommentstnkcalistoffeministresourcestacklingmensissues

NONE sure teaching people not to rape is a great idea not people in general men specifically and exclusively also they are addressing it by arguing against the idea that men are alway up for sex and always want sex the idea of consent including male consent is a cornerstone of feminism if so it s a cornerstone they do nt talk about much but we re just going around in circle you re just not getting it and i do nt think you re really interested in exploring a different point of view actually you re the one not getting it screaming at men that they re toxic is nt going to actually address systemic bias against them no matter how much you insist otherwise
AH logically there is nothing wrong with that statement your right and i did nt say he wa wrong but it is a moronic statement to make devoid of any meaning or insight given the reality we know how useful would it be for me to declare that rod blagojevich would have been an exemplary state governor if he did nt do corrupt thing like conspire to sell obama s senate seat to the highest bidder anyway this is getting offtopic
NONE all right yeah i would certainly concede that case because someone still thinking it wa the best option at the time would be making pretty much an entirely incoherent argument to then oppose it for someone else however would you agree that it can be valid with the scenario where the person ha just completely had a change of heart though like roe who say she wa mistaken the entire time or the murderer who say he never should have done it

AH that s fine if that s all you care about oh fuck off with this we re talking about racism on reddit reread the title of this post a few time you re literally arguing that reddit should nt make rule against racism until capitalism is dismantled this is a starving kid in africa argument predicated on the assumption that if i do nt want racism in my private sphere then i must be fine with it in the public sphere that assumption literally make no goddamn sense
NONE communism wo nt work for the exact same reason you think it s unfair the greed of man if people were nt greedy taking thing that they do nt deserve they would nt be lazy either communism is not unfair in principle because in principle everyone would work equally communism need perfect human and perfect human would nt run into the problem you re talking about in the first place so if you had a real communist society the problem you talking about would nt exist anyway

AH why do you think differently abled mean the same thing a disabled the first is purely descriptive it simply point at a difference in ability the second is normative and therefore a value judgement it relies on some standard of what it mean to be fully abled in order to proclaim that it subject is not and it is wellunderstood that it is better to be the former rather than the latter anyone could pick out that difference without knowing anything about pc culture so i m wondering how and why you re getting a weasel word vibe here a well i do nt get your exasperation with being asked to use certain word instead of others it take more than no effort but it seems lazy to hand wave everything without considering it merit first
NONE a good argument stand on it own detail about the speaker s identity are irrelevant with the exception of a very limited set of issue all that matter is whether or not your argument is logical and that it is nt filled with rhetoric and fallacy i agree with op if someone is being dismissive of your position on something just because of your age it s probably because they do nt have a real argument to back up their position piece of advice next time someone feed you that line of i used to think that when i wa your age reply to them what changed your mind if they give you something vague like just experience then ask for detail like what experience if they still fail to produce a compelling reason for why their position is the correct one do nt be afraid to call that to attention

AH you are not familiar with them who would you say is an eminent psychological researcher today an eminent psychological researcher is like asking you who the eminent palm reader is fuck off firstly you were dismissing the entire field not it s relavence to this one particular question i m dismissing it because it is not science neuroscience will replace the nonsense that is psychology second your question really ha more to do with defining mental illness so you ve turned it into a philosophical debate now i asked you a simple fucking question you danced around it with a wall of text that is psychology here s a simpler question is oedipal complex real doe it exist what experiment are there to test for oedipal complex here s the difference between psychology and neuroscience a child wa having behavioral issue so a psychologist studied this child and then claimed the child wa autistic the mother did nt believe him and took her child to a neuroscientist the neuroscientist checked the child and discovered that the child ha tiny brain seizure fixed the brain seizure and the autism magically went away a psychologist s opinion is no different than a priest s opinion that the child is taken over by satan
NONE so we ca nt apply strict logic to something that defies it i do nt think you re correctly applying logic to the situation if jesus indeed rose from the dead is there a logical explanation for how a man died and then lived after several day no defies all law of biology physic do we throw out logic then no i would say not we could indeed examine the event surrounding it to see if there s perhaps a more logical explanation such a the resurrection wa faked made up in order to start a religion is there any logical explanation a to how a vaccuum cleaner can be the most powerful most durable in the world and is only offered by door to door salesman no you got ta pay for quality this is insane how can this be probably the guy knocking on my door at pm is lying is it more likely that a man defied all law of biology and physic or is it more likely that some people made it up to start a religion given what we know about modern religion such a scientology and space pirate thetans and soul trapped in volcano that is that a religion can be created by someone writing a book that is we have proof that a man wrote a book and a religion came into being we have no proof that a man rose from the dead

AH you re clearly not gifted either because you do nt understand squat about how intelligence let alone giftedness work at all being gifted doe nt mean that person is suddenly perfect at everything even thing they ve never even thought about and never ever make any mistake someone supremely intelligent imagine someone more intelligent than einstein who s never taken the bus before is still going to look dumb when the driver tell them to scan their card if you ve never ever in your entire life heard of sexually transmitted disease then even the most intelligent human ever is going to have unprotected sex with whoever because why the hell not pointing at failure and defect doe nt prove that someone ai nt so smart after all huh honestly your comment is enraging and would win a trolling contest on any giftedchildren forum yes i feel better getting that out of my system
NONE do you mean global in the sense of a person s worth to the world or like a person s overall worth i m not sure a lot of people think about their worth to the world but bad selfesteem is feeling bad about yourself a a person someone with bad selfesteem is unable to recognize the talent and positive trait they have or think those trait do nt matter even if you ve never felt that way did nt you know anyone in high school who thought they were worthless even though they were a perfectly normal high schooler the whole idea of selfesteem is that if you do nt like yourself you ca nt accomplish anything because you have no confidence selfesteem allows you to look at a thing you achieved and say wow i did such a good job rather than eh this is nt that big a deal or even yeah but it doe nt matter because i fucked up that one part

NONE if someone is saying you re wrong do nt say that arguing with the do nt say that doe nothing to further your argument if you ca nt or do nt argue the you re wrong part of the sentence too on the other side of the coin if someone s first response to hearing something wrong is do nt say that then there s probably little point in arguing with the you re wrong part of the sentence since they likely are nt going to be receptive to any argument no matter how much logic and evidence is behind them
AH is this your first time on our planet
NONE did this change your view on the subject then
AH oh dear cmv is painful sometimes truly painfulyou set out with the very first sentence of your post to do away with the kind of objection based on the i do nt want or do nt feel comfortable tackling the thing you are actually referring to so i want to knock down some other thing i could nt have been more clear here it is repeated literally the first sentence of the op i want to make it clear that i am talking about one specific aspect of rape culture the idea that female behaviour or female clothing encourages or explains rapei am not addressing some other aspect again i want to make it clear that i am talking about one specific aspect of rape culture the idea that female behaviour or female clothing encourages or explains rapei am not addressing some other aspect
NONE i get your point but i m talking about feeling when you ask someone for the hour there s nothing directly related to feeling learning the time may cause me to feel relief or anxiety and revealing the time may make the stranger feel useful or irritated and there is a major difference between deliberate seductive behavior and normal human interaction the latter ha no previous purpose related to feeling if something happens say someone fall in love it happened the former is a kind of behavior that ha a deliberate objective changing the way the other person see you is nt it manipulative i do nt think it s true that normal human interaction are unrelated to feeling how would that work we re often trying to engender feeling in other people eg if we comb our hair to appear neat
AH accuse me of having mental health problem someone who doesnt intrinsically understand the innate need to protect their young universal in nearly every animal in the history of planet earth is a strong candidate for such a diagnosis
NONE your view is based on a fundamental error some people are in favour of abortion while also recognising that life begin at conception they acknowledge that abortion is the killing of a human being in development and would nt necessarily condone the using of that human being for any purpose
AH however men who get a financial abortion are abandoning their child actual living and breathing human so he should kill it instead right this is not what is happening the mother is not voiding herself of responsibility at all she is taking responsibility by having the abortion she ha to make that decision she ha to live with it she is not abandoning her child she is not allowing it to exist guy ha to live with it too the guilt also she is removing responsibility for a child for year which sound rather nice if only men could make the same choice regarding their life and parent status right you do nt think the situation should be equal you think the situation should favor men giving men a choice the same a a woman is not favoring men if abortion had to be a mutual decision for both parent regarding their child my argument would fall apart it s a good thing i m arguing with an emotional child though
NONE here s the view i will try to change this woman is not your best friend you mention she wa making him feel better and that she felt awkward inviting you that is not prioritizing you at all that is not acting how a best friend would act it may or may not be your fault that the marriage ended you may or may not deserve sympathy regardless a best friend would have your back not your ex s let s be real here though we know this best friend is not concerned with being sympathetic to your ex because he is in need and she is so empathatic she is acting selfishly and putting her want first with zero regard for the impact on you you should take her to task for this and whatever the result remember she is the one who caused this by taking these nonbest friend action you are just the one who finally addressed the elephant in the room it may hurt to hear but that woman is not your friend
AH tranny really slur i do nt know how tall you are but at least the last part of your username is accurate

NONE hey it s against reddit rule to post on thing linked from best of
AH holy shit never thought i d see the day where some internet kid is telling someone who s in the military about the military you re ridiculous the declared and inherent purpose you re claiming to base your argument on is a crock of shit most military specialty are not combat specialty yes technically everyone in the military can pick up a gun and shoot it but that is not how it work in reality infantry and special force go through much more training than your average joe to prepare them for combat they are combat personnel the people in maintenance medical and finance are not they are support personnel a catastrophic situation where a dining facility cook need to pick up a gun and operate a combat personnel is not realistic and we do not train for that you can get medically disqualified from thing like infantry and special force but still serve in field like intelligence or medical you have no idea what you re talking about at all stop you re misinforming people with your feigned understanding of the military
NONE so the thing is activating the selective service registration is a desperate emergency sort of situation we re not going to do that unless we do nt have the time to beef up the army with volunteer we re talking zombie apocalypse ok sudden invasion by the chinese level of emergency here the modern army simply doe nt need or want draftee it s a highly skilled technical profession requiring experienced troop now so what s my point it s true that a few woman are capable of taking on the role of infantry soldier and we should let them do so without prejudice but the vast majority are nt they simply lack the upper body strength to be anything but a hindrance if you re going to keep a reserve around for emergency where there s little time available for being selective it only make sense to have that reserve come from a group where of the group is qualified rather than a group where only is it would be a huge waste of time and resource to sift through all woman in a draft situation to find the few that you can throw into the breech a shock troop without getting in the way
AH no i mostly think that when you post two demonstrably contradictory statement in a cmv then that mean you owe someone a delta and no i m not referring to myself and to some extent yes you are supposed to question the thing that you accepted without a second thought when you were younger i do nt think you are a fucking idiot for listening to school and obeying the law but blindly accepting what you re told when you re a fully grown adult which granted i am perhaps incorrectly assuming you are is pretty indicative of stupidity or at least a lack of critical thinking the fact that you posted this cmv at all mean that you ve probably realized that you should question the thing you re told but the fact that you did nt seem to take any of it in despite people pointing out logical inconsistency in your views would seem to indicate that you had no interest in having your view changed to begin with hence this appeared for all intent and purpose to be a troll and a waste of time i guess it s better that you re responding now than never but this sub is nt called change my view in two week also you do nt know what it s like to be told something all your life only to have it massively contradicted by the internet absolutely i do and i would hazard a guess that so do most people from the generation that grew up with the internet that s definitely nothing unusual
NONE i agree in general but i think there s something vital that you re missing religious people believe in their religion full stop they believe that they know the truth it s not dogma it s not a choice it ha nothing to do with rationality it s just the truth for those people there are lot of thing we mostly agree to be true in our culture that are nt agreed upon in other culture and there are legitimate scientific facts that some people will despute the veracity of so where do you draw the line if it s not okay for someone to teach their religion which they believe to be true to their kid how is it okay for me to teach my child that the earth is round when the flat earth folk would disagree with that how is it okay for me to teach my child that x y or z is wrong when there are certainly people out there who disagree edit i m getting a lot of response that address the flat earth example but it appears that people are stopping there instead of reading the rest of my comment it admittedly wa nt the perfect example but one bad example doe nt negate a good example or show that my argument is flawed i m just going to ignore these type of response from now on because they re not relevant to the point being made if you want to engage with this argument you ll need to address the second example which i ve now bolded
AH spending a shit ton of money on our defense to create a money war they lost but still cost u a shit ton those are two different thing nbsp i dunno i m gon na have to side with scientist and doctor over the host of the apprentice on this one trump is asking for scientific research reading comprehension is your friend nbsp okay he s bigoted or prejudiced against the ethnicity of hispanic better no okay then because in your mind enforcing federal law is bigoted or prejudiced

AH since you re not getting it i ll spell it out nice and simple for ya yo a·nal·o·gy əˈnaləjē noun a comparison between two thing typically for the purpose of explanation or clarification an analogy between the working of nature and those of human society a correspondence or partial similarity the syndrome is called deep dysgraphia because of it analogy to deep dyslexia a thing that is comparable to something else in significant respect work of art were seen a an analogy for work of nature that s how analogy work you condescending dipshit they necessarily involve comparison of two different thing the part that is meaningful is the fucking relationship between those thing you want to act like you re so much fucking better than i am because you can repeat yourself yet you ca nt handle the most basic concept from the sat you made your own totally irrelevant nonsequitur comparison and could nt explain a logical relationship from it then when i called out that it seemed unrelated you went no u yet never actually explained why the logical relationship i identified somehow did nt exist all you have done is circularly repeat your own stupid shit you literally just said it s different because it s different which is because they re different and you were a condescending prick about it you demonstrated that you do nt actually have any reasoning to defend your statement and you also demonstrated that you ca nt be polite about having been cornered in your arbitrary shit logic seriously how the fuck did you even ever end up on this sub let alone get delta did you stand around repeating your point with no reasoning for those too fuck you very much hope you fix that craniorectal inversion eventually
NONE the point of language is to convey meaning in a clear and easy way a possible that s why we have structure it would nt make sense to have no rule and no organization to english i get that but is our understanding of what you re trying to say really diminished because you said loose when you really meant lose at most it took a half second to realize oh he meant the other word the thing is that this half a second can be jarring and it can happen multiple time in a short space of time if somebody ha gotten into the habit of misusing the language when you re reading a sentence you have a lifetime of experience priming you to expect certain word combination to mean certain thing for example when you see their in a sentence you expect the rest of sentence to refer to something that belongs to somebody or a trait that they posse if somebody writes something like i loose my key and their over their i have to go back and decipher what wa originally intended if what somebody writes doe not clearly and neareffortlessly convey their original intent then they have genuinely introduced a barrier to understanding it may be small barrier but it s a barrier nonetheless that said there are case where being technically incorrect really doe nt make much of a difference at all these day i see would of written down all the time and it s getting to the point where reading it is effortless and when people write le instead of fewer i do nt think that there are a significant number of people reading it who have to genuinely take the time to understood what is written so i would definitely say that it depends on the specific error or idiom but yes i think that correcting somebody s grammar can indeed aid effective communication
AH so if the u withdrew it protectorate from japan and korea nothing would happen is this what you are saying i just want to be clear it s this level of naiveté i m dealing with
NONE it s nice to see someone else with this opinion i ve been afraid to voice it out of fear of being called a fat shamer when that s not at all where my concern come from

AH i could explain it but you were born into a lack of understanding about music
NONE i thought this wa already a well know thought and feel of the community
AH if there were any indication that you d actually take the time to clearly define the term you wish to use and how you wish to use them a well a providing any proof what so ever that your assertion are true i might be tempted to continue a it is you have flatly and explicitly refused to do do i must then assume that you ate every bit a full of shit a i first estimated you to be and you know it therefore your refusal is a sad attempt to mask the fact peace out and may your inane psuedo philosophical twaddle forever cloud your mind to reality
NONE they should indeed have their will respected just like with regular inheritance which is why you can opt out similarly by default all your stuff go to your spouse and child when you die and you have to write a will if you decide you want to give it away to someone else it would be silly to have the default inheritance law say that all your earthly possession will be buried with you unless you make a will that state otherwise although people totally should be able to put that in a will and have it done regardless of how silly we think it is
AH union can be corrupt or too strong so can people but we can not therefore conclude that people are bad you ca nt say your average business owner is amoral good thing i never said that then is nt it it seems that you do nt even consider what i m saying at all just because i believe all woman are inherently against male thank you for admitting you are a sexist pig
NONE doe nt this validate the initial claim though no you claimed that people always were attempting to deflect the burden of choice when saying they do nt care sometimes people really do nt care and your supporting observation are simply that sometimes people are nt truthful it is like saying when your wife say everything is fine she is just building up anger because thing are nt fine sometimes that may be true but sometimes thing are actually fine
AH oh okay so can i have a link to the time a fetus ha had a conversation with someone just like how someone in a coma can come to and begin regaining piece of who they are right away since they both have consciousness in the present like the original point wa the number of time you have contradicted yourself is fascinating please continue if love to see you dig the hole your in even deeper if you had been aborted which frankly would have been a relief for everyone but you would not have been killed because you would nt never have become you you ca nt kill something that ha no self awareness or consciousness otherwise you should also be opposed to people getting limb amputated you should be opposed to any sort of medication hell you should be opposed to antibody you are clearly so biased towards this that no matter what people tell you you will keep on supporting a sad and pathetic perspective that only help to destroy or devastate other family because your ego is too big to just shut the fuck up about your belief enjoy hell when you get there it s only place your inconsiderate as would ever be accepted
NONE i have another viewpoint to consider op which is my personal viewpoint i used to think along the same line a you regarding the purpose of life what i concluded wa that life doe not actually have a purpose unless you are religious but it apears you and me both are nt science doe not give a reason for our existence besides you exist to make more of you and you are the result of thousand of generation acting on this impulse i find this actually quite liberating i personally think that you should just live life according to what you want and what you think is right the only purpose in living is the purpose you give it if you want to hate life go ahead because it doe nt matter but you will have a much better time trying to make yourself happier and you can do that in whichever way you want because it wo nt matter in the end unless it involves you hurting other people i mainly mean if you are feeling like getting money or a job or a spouse is not important do nt do it even if it seems like there huge societal pressure to do all those thing sorry for grammerspellingclarity issue i typed this all on my shitty fake phone

NONE everyone else ha already done a good job of pointing out that funeral are about the living not the dead etc what i want to emphasize is that writing an honest eulogy wo nt stand to gain anything for you or for anyone else even if it make you feel better it would be at the cost of making his loved one feel worse and if you try to justify making yourself happy at the expense of so many others then you would be about a terrible a you claim your former friend wa

AH the selfdefense analogy doe nt really work because the implication is that if you do nt kill the other person they will likely end up killing you and if i do nt abort my fetus or have a miscarriage i will definitely end up being forced into a major lifethreatening surgery i do nt have any obligation to give someone with renal failure my kidney i do nt have any obligation to give a hungry beggar my food i do nt have any obligation to give an intruder my valuable i do nt have any obligation to host a parasitic human it s simple really other people s right do nt override my own nobody ha a right to take those thing from me or force me to go through a major life upheaval without my consent so yes it s analogous to selfdefense i just did and you ignored it maybe you think you did but no there s no valid point there no i m not you want to let a woman kill her unborn child how is that not prodeath she ll kill it whether it s legal or not if we allow her to do so in a safe clean environment she ha a better chance of living through it you want to force woman to have dangerous abortion thats prodeath and it s also antichoice you re clearly not capable of having a rational discussion say the guy who consistently misuse word and fails to grasp concept like bodily autonomy and human right you do nt care about truth you care about belittling the other side that s cute coming from someone who s done nothing but belittle me during this whole conversation hello pot this is kettle are you sitting down
NONE i m not shaming you though i just asked if you ve ever critically analyzed these belief just because society say this is the way thing are doe nt mean you have to blindly accept it it s fine that you want to be oldfashioned you obviously like chivalry and being a gentleman that s fine i personally do nt care for chivalry whether or not a man open a door or pay for dinner just really doe nt matter to me courtesy is courtesy regardless of gender i do nt want to be treated differently or put on a pedestal just because i m a woman do nice thing for me because you genuinely like me not because society say you have to because i have a vagina but there are many woman that do like it like you said and i have nothing against that but it is problematic when you start calling people loser because they do nt fit into stereotypical gender role it s the s leave it to beaver nuclear family model doe nt really exist anymore family have a wide range of option now and there s no reason at all for couple to stick to traditional gender role now if they do nt want or need to i m the breadwinner in my marriage and my husband take on more housecleaning childcare duty he s not a loser you may think he is but he s not our arrangement work for u we live how we want and we re happy what s wrong with that why do you judge u why should we have to live differently what s wrong with my husband spending more time with the kid and what s wrong with me focusing more of my time on work who care

AH gt i do nt see nazi going door to do killing minority i do nt see any organized effort from the altright to commit violence on their opposite i see that happening on the left though ohhh you re one of those people ffs the only thing you ve done this thread is prove you are in fact a nazi sympathizer

AH so you are just agreeing with him you might a well not post if you re just trying to circle jerk
NONE unless they re wasted and being aggressiveinappropriate to random people i do nt see a problem
AH holy shit i rarely use the word feminazi but i think we ve found the golden goose here remember that part about me blatantly ignoring the pc train this qualifies i m sure it s been pointed out to you but remember that all of the cultural privilege that you cite are the result of institutionalized sexism and patriarchy the world isnt that terrible and the patriarchy you speak of brought u a a country and a specie pretty damn far patriarchy is no more sexist or evil than feminism after all feminism ultimate goal is matriarchy which is what your type have been marching towards ever since you started swarming bar with hymn and ruined the u economy with temperance and prohibition your foremother lied to entire generation http listversecomoutrageousclaimsmadebythetemperancemovement just to take away thing that men loved and it took crime rising to unprecedented level and the economic woe of the great depression before president roosevelt wa brave enough to go up against your type and end prohibition do not attack patriarchy when feminism is doing and ha done just a much if not more harm to society patriarchy brought humankind to the cusp of greatness time again what ha feminism brought u prohibition and subsequently the great depression and a generation of people raised on lie pc culture and the rising demasculinity of men everywhere resulting in a loss of gumption and people who are too easily offended fuck feminism
NONE i m from the south and i grew up learning that the civil war wa fought over the state right to condoneabolish slavery i also learned that it wa a very complex issue and that the motivation of individual are different than the motivation of their government but in the big picture slavery wa at the heart of it and they really liked slavery slavery bad abolition good you re right in the sense that both side are talking past each other but i do nt think your post is entirely accurate i ve never heard anyone say that the south had the moral right to secede or that this wa the most important lesson i do nt think they d get very far with this either i m pretty sure they had no legal right to secede and a war to preserve the ability to own people doe nt strike me a moral or an effective debate technique i think people are rebelling for lack of a better term against the idea that the saintly enlightened northerner bravely fought the evil dastardly southerner instead they emphasize the part of the story that are nt so clearly immoral or temper it with the recognition that while slavery is evil you ca nt entirely judge people of the past by today s moral standard they re not necessarily wrong either war is a complex issue in other word it s not that they care about broader lesson or philosophical discussion of selfdetermination it s more about rephrasing it in a way that doe nt paint them or their ancestor out a entirely evil that s very important when discussing how we deal with the legacy of slaveryracism
AH but it s not he asked for a view change correct he present his view correct are we not aiming to change part of his view come on brain use it buddy

AH you can not refute the fact of my argument and you insulted my intelligence first talking down to me like i wa stupid and ignorant the bias is all yours friend telling me that i m only informed by fear when it s you that is afraid of losing your lousy job making money by polluting the environment with radioactive waste and telling me falsely that there are no country that get of their energy from clean and renewable source you probably do nt even work in the industry it s just some talking point that you picked up so have a great day i know i will having shown you up to be a liar and a hypocrite

AH do nt post if you do nt have a fucking view you can defend what s the counter argument to i have zero basis to a feeling that make no difference in my action or behavior get the fuck over it
NONE can you add they also do nt go outside enough to actually experience of the thing they complain about to your statement please i ca nt change your view because it s likely correct
AH they eat more food we already waste of the world s food production so it s pretty damned clear that this is nt an issue food waste is not a good thing you point out that there is a problem and then claim that people making it worse is not a problem learn to debate they consume more oxygen what doe this even mean are you worried we will run out of air i m simply pointing out that they consume too much and contribute too little fat people are parasite they contribute far le to the planet this is entirely subjective and make no sense gabe newell is fat and he invented steam well done you named one fat fuck who is a sucsess and who did you pick a guy who make videogames well done now name a single fatfuck who actually contributed something of significance to the planet without having to google it tip santa is nt real they are on average le intelligent again this is literally subjective and not true they have the exact same intelligence a any other human being on the face of planet earth the negative association between intelligence and obesity ha been well established google it when you have finished eating fatty they are a burden on our healthcare system so are mentally ill people disabled people and chronically ill people in the sense that they require even miniscule amount of extra funding this is an issue of capitalism not fat people no it is an issue of fat people fat people can fix themselves easily mentally and chronically ill people can not fuck them
NONE thus again if the fat man put a on obesity why should society persue to make it so that he considerss it a le people being fat and le people smoking is good for a society and a person not being fat nor smoking is good for them individually so i would instead ask why not if something is good for both the affected individual and the rest of the group clearly it is the right choice regarding your last sentence yes the point is simply to have le fat people and le smoker to help a many people a possible while at the same time helping the society in a society where it is more acceptable to have these flaw more people will have and maintain them therefore i do nt see how it is productive to make such flaw more acceptable i ca nt imagine how it would help me if everyone around me suddenly decided my weight wa nt my fault i see no benefit in this i am not going to suddenly lose weight because people stopped judging me for it i consider this idea completely absurd there is no study in the world that will convince me that i would lose weight if only people stopped judging me when the only effect that people judging me ha on me is wanting to lose weight even more than i otherwise would a far a tourette s etc go that s why i said repairable flaw thing you can fix but lack the motivation to there is obviously no point in bashing people over something they ca nt fix although they still need to be separated from society if they are dangerous a person with tourette s is nt but there are mentally ill people who are regardless of it not being their own fault
AH the donald is a circlejerk sub how do you people not understand this politics and politicadiscussion are for discussing politics the donald is for shitposting about trump go to rdemocrat and post somthing to the right while you are at it if you think td is an accurate comparison i am restraining from calling you all kind of shit right now
NONE a lot of the argument liberal make on those issue is that there s structural oppression of various group and conservative hear that and react in bemusement where s the bad person doing the bad thing if they do nt see it then it just seems unfair and suspicious for these people to get all this attention when no one is even doing anything to them

AH ahhh i see i also believe that you are incorrect in this assessment of what occurred between u you initially posted in my experience it is impossible to talk about men having problem in any way whether or not you bring up woman or feminism without feminist showing up and calling the speaker an autistic manchild misogynist who life in his parent basement diplomacy and tact do nothing to reduce this then i responded hey everybody this guy s cartoonish anecdote prof u all wrong pack it up we re done here mother fucker got this shit on lock down you believe that wa a perfect illustration of your cartoonish anecdote detailed in your initial post it wa not not even close at no point did you talk about men having problem in any way nor at any point did i calling the speaker an autistic manchild misogynist who life in his parent basement i did mock your low effort meaningless hyperbolic post but in that post you were not talking about men having problem and in my mocking i never called you an autistic manchild misogynist so i wa confused when you said case in fucking point but now i understand you were just wrong and had nothing to contribute to the conversation
NONE while agree that anyone who enacted your first little vignette would be in my estimation an obnoxious twat i feel i must still challenge a part of your view to that end who the fuck care i mean honestly anyone who would do this is very likely obnoxious regardless of what flavor of which bullshit identity politics they are pedaling the proper response to this is not to form a sense of righteous indignation at having been labeled incorrectly the horrorr it s to either walk the fuck away or if you think it s worth your time say something along the line of awesome so if you re a feminist what the fuck have you done what program have you volunteered for what child have you mentored what step have you taken to elevate yourself from having adopted a fashionable label to actually enabling some change in the world it really really really doe not matter what label you put on yourself or on others it s about what you do not what you purport to be a is often the case in most thing the people in my life i respect the most who identify a feminist rarely if ever actually announce it they do shit so yeah technically i suppose you re correct self identification is the only reasonable standard but honestly it doe nt fucking matter enough to warrant thought
AH i bet you re a real ball to hang out with

NONE i did nt ask for the definition that wa someone else when people talk about racism they re not just talking about whether someone think a race is superior or inferior they re also talking about the way that race are treated differently ultimately the reason attitude matter is because they inform action and action that target or disproportionately disadvantage certain race are racist by the definition given above because whether someone feel a certain way is nt what s important what s important is the action they take that s what is focused on if you re supporting racist system even if you do nt personally feel racist yourself is there any meaningful difference what distinction are you trying to draw
AH i m not sure how taxation make my car go maybe combine it with liberal tear for power or how we need taxation to pay for road since lot of state have private road paid for by voluntary useage toll or non state maintained open road also despite all the feel the bern post reddit is privately owned a are the communication line and the power line piping those lively little electron into my house got a privately dug well good no government poisoning of your water supply like in flint got a septic system on your property good no government arbitrarily raising your public sewer use rate to pad their budget pay or do nt for private fire protection good you determined your own level of risk without coercion and can cancel at any time now repeat after me taking my money against my will regardless of how it is later spent is stealing and stealing is bad mmmkay see i knew you could maybe just maybe have a rational thought also somalia is not exactly a tax free state it s more of a place where mafia style warlord take whatever they think is appropriate from your ever shrinking money supply in the name of your protection wait maybe i m thinking of those asshole in dc fuck off with your nanny state bullshit and keep your filthy hand our of my wallet there s really no hope for idiot like you because you ll always support hurting people and that s morally indefensible
NONE it seems like we are nt really changing your view then we re just giving you more information to help you change your view to something you already know is a little off i m sure people come here from many position and mentality so i wo nt get into that but i guess i m just fishing for more perspective on where the fault lie the bottom line is that a government a democratic one is there to facilitate society and govern it s easy to see authority a coming from the top president pm leader congressman mp whatever but how much do you validate authority from the bottom up people want marijuana to be legalized because for all it fault it is nt worse than alcohol or anything else really and it s really not that bad in general while many people ca nt stand stoner and weed culture i find it so bland and uninspiring that s separate from spending tax dollar on locking people up instead of getting tax dollar from selling something that wo nt lead to rampant madness or even a little madness is it better to put someone in the u at least away for a year or is it better to let them contribute to the economy their community and their family while also buying marijuana and other product thus supporting a business and paying more in tax

NONE yeah sure if you wan na say that then go for it the only thing you need to keep in mind is who you re talking to this go back to me saying the point of communication is to get a point across if you re talking to somebody who regularly us the word colour to indicate non white or black thing then effective communication would involve using that definition it s not they you re wrong or right and it s not that they re wrong or right it s that in order to communicate properly everyone need to be on the same page

AH i ve been listening to hip hop for over year and since kanye came out he wa always a product of hype he ha always been a great producer with not even passable skill a an mc when he came out hip hop had been in steep decline since the mid with rapper relying more and more on gimmick andor manufactured image to get by kanye s stuff had mainstream appeal and wa nt about the same bullshit college dropout wa a breath of fresh air and one of the only good hip hop album from the early s but it s not a mic album goodgreat production with very mediocre rapping and that wa his peak a an artist his supposed magnus opus my beautiful dark twisted fantasy is pretentious and overrated for god sake the best song on the album is runaway and it take full minute before the song actually start in my view people bought into the idea that kanye wa an autistic tortured genius and they ve insulated themselves from hearing any criticism of him he s gotten worse and worse over time but because he can pas off any of his new garbage a experimental his fan will eat it up i always hear the same defense of him he s an asshole but he make great music or he s not like other mainstream rapper or you just must not like hip hop fuck you you bought into his celebrity bullshit and like a lot of his fan you decide you re going to like his music before you even listen to it
NONE could you be looking at this from the wrong angle you re asking two completely different thing why people do nt listen to classical music is it because classical music doe nt have a drum set the way i see it is that most people stick with what they re used to or exposed to at some formative age i know someone who listened to a ton of classical music because his father used to play it in the house while he wa growing up his dad wa very knowledgeable about the composer artist etc and passed that on to his son i on the other hand wa exposed to a ton of classical rock from my friend when i wa growing up that s still the music that i like the most and he still like classical music best in fact i did nt get into classical music at all i m still a noob until i watched requiem for a dream and got blown away by the soundtrack kronos quartet did an amazing job though my friend tried i wa resistant to it because of my own lack of training that s how it is with exposure to music if you show me what s popular right now i would just stare blankly at the list the whole taylor swiftnicki minaj drama meant nothing to me because i do nt know a single song by minaj so it is nt a matter of the quality of the music it s more about exposure and discovery classical music is nt a presence the same way pop music is i think that s what account for the difference in popularity great post by the way let me know what you think about my

AH so did you bother to actually read and understand the argument do you have any actual refutation of the premise other than that s stupid care to have a mature conversation that is nt based on attacking someone and just being an outright negative prick
NONE i do nt like the x privilege argument either but your claim that everyone who us it is terrible and parasitic ha quite a burden of proof would we only need to find one person that ha used the argument who is nt insufferable to be aroundtotally unproductive
AH it s not toxic masculinity to not want to bang a dude in a dress you loon
NONE god what a joke this is why people say it s not their job to educate
AH lol ok there you might not like to but you did just use a fallacy whats odd is that you knew you were doing it im beginning to wonder if youre actually any good at math at all it not a language that describes the same concept a common tongue but it is a language that describes very specific thing and sure it might be used alongside another language toget a point across but it is also a language of it own that very precisely describes specific thing if you want to call it a dialect so you can sleep better about your pissing contest be my guest but i think it fully deserves the title of language if you sent nothing but math say trigonometry or somehing to an alien civilization they would be able to decipher it without ever learning any other of our language and then you could start explaining to them thing using math alone where it get tricky is when you need to define variable pi is an easy one cosine etcetera a well integral and sum are pretty basic also but it get more tricky if you want to send the message emc but thats more physic anyway it is also common for language to borrow word from other language for example we say sushi and tsunami and basically all the asian language use english for more modern word for computer related word for example that doesnt mean they arent language a dialect is a form of another language which is usually regional math is it own thing sorry not to use fallacy but youre full of shit
NONE language actually extends far beyond conveying an intended message or rather it conveys very many message some of which may or may not be intentional i agree that for the purpose of simply understand something like the dog is behind the house grammar may seem unimportant there is great beauty in language do nt even think of poem just think of your average joe car salesman pitch a good salesman sell you something whilst making friend with you and you do nt even really feel like he s selling you anything their control of language is something we can all try to emulate care with language ha a whole lot of connotation i would not use careless syntax and grammar just like i would not want to be minute late for a business meeting laziness is not an appreciated quality it doe make a small difference in the speed it take u to register thing research show that unconsciously we like idea conveyed in amore easily readunderstood fashion big clear font with nice contrast from background for example for those who are able to grasp it relatively easily like native speaker the amount of effort spent learning it compared to using it is negligible for those who can not grasp it easily they are still able to be understood and it s something that gradually improves anyways there is little harm done in having that extra aspiration for grammatical rule
AH you are just being absurdly childish now nothing you said even make sense
NONE not to sound pushy but i think you can award delta s even if you re not op
AH you re a fear mongering xenophobe and it s people like you that are causing war there s two kind of people peaceful people like me and most of the muslim and extremist like you and the terrorist

NONE it appears that the one attempt to answer your question about delta provided an example but doe nt explain how or whenwhy you would do so according to the rulesexplanations over there in the sidebar you award a delta anytime any comment from anyone change your view in any way along with typing in the code for a delta you are supposed to include an explanation of how your view ha been qualified modified reworded or changed from your previous view to award a delta you type the character that correspond to the following word with no space in between ampersand hashtag eight seven one zero semicolon
AH why would people believe something that can be proven wrong you probably live in some wonderful place in europe or canada while your internet habit are mostly limited to this sub it s understandable however outside these beautiful place there are people who believe that the earth is year old that climate change is a hoax or that allah want them to kill random innocent people to get to heaven censoring these kind of thing for most people could be perfectly justified a there s absolutely no chance of them being right the issue here is whether it s worth it to limit freedom of speech at all even when there s no chance that speech will lead to something useful in this case i think it is better to argue against viewpoint you see a completely wrong a there are other people who agree with them censoring these viewpoint mean you and others with the same opinion lose the chance to counter them not necessarily you just have to censor those opinion not the rebate in a censorhappy world you would nt be able to talk about how great it is to kill people for your god but someone would be more than happy to argue why that idea is retarded
NONE someone who doe believe in god ha an inherent sense of comfort in knowing that death is not the end this is certainly true and death is also terrifying to me but really it is what it is we can freak the hell out about death or we can realize that that make the time we have all the more meaningful the belief that we have x amount of time to do what we can make that time so much more valuable compared to if we had x infinity is x more meaningful on it own or if you dilute it with infinity i could play word game and use philosophical argument to try to get you to buy some rationalization for why atheism is more meaningful what is truly the case in my opinion is that you are in control of making your own meaning people who are religious simply adopt a culture that teach them what meaning they should pursue being an atheist mean you are allowed to find it on your own sure that might seem horrible at first but once you start to build it for yourself it will be more fulfilling than some meaning you borrowed from someone else
AH i do nt work for the government and we probably agree on a great deal of policy your choice to support austrian school is insane it like claiming there is no fire while your house is on fire because rationally you could nt explain how the fire started thus it is not real hell friedman s work is hugely important to modern economics clearly figure who would be described a libertarian are important to the field yet you still want to support the kook because feelz realz austrian s make thousand and thousand of prediction and then seize on those that are correct by chance to continue selling their drivel you say austrian better predicts have you noticed how mainstream economics doe nt predict have you considered why a for better explaining economic activity only if you choose to ignore what you can observe abct simply fails when you look at business cycle a do most business cycle theory the difference between mainstream and austrian is that we keep rejecting business cycle theory when they have been shown to be wrong rather then keeping them in monetary policy they fail also this http researchstlouisfedorgfredseriesbase alone should have austrian s falling at the foot of real economist and begging them to teach them every austrian economist predicted hyperinflation a a result of qe we do nt think the government is the solution to everything your lord master try to convince you that mainstream economics is worshiping at the foot of keynes when we mostly reject his work today you have been sold a fraudulent idea my friend
NONE consider the law of unintended consequence if it ai nt broke do nt fix it and generally our ability to use pure reason to predict outcome perfectly is extremely limited if you have a family and everyone ha food shelter a decent education etc simply put every new proposal amount to you risking what you already have when you have thing pretty good that last thing you want is to risk losing that simply because some egghead think there s a better way but lack any humility to acknowledge that they might in fact be wrong take one example america s large military budget now one might be able to point out all the benefit we might have if we reduced the military but in actuality nobody actually knows what american life would be like after that change obviously people who are struggling are going to generally be more willing to take risk with policy ie progressivism while those who are pretty comfortable will want far le risk ie conservativism american life are nt some theoretical model to be tested on repeatedly we re talking hundred of million of real people whose life could be severely made worse if a new idea doe nt pan out the way it wa intended personally i want this country to become far more progressive ultimately ending up with something like what bernie sander is campaigning on but i d like to see those kind of thing a a longterm goal that we reach with careful baby step that s why we need traditional value to curb our society from changing too quickly in way that we by no mean have guaranteed outcome

NONE feel free to report me done you really should save yourself the trouble of coming to this sub if all you plan to do is insult people and refuse to defend your own stated position
AH you repeatedly demonstrate that you are incapable of or unwilling to comprehend the word that you see before you and still you have the temerity and gall to think that you have the ability credibility or authority to correct anyone on any topic and you wonder why i m a little testy
NONE again we re speaking from two very different perspective it s practically impossible to have this discussion i do nt think anybody should have to testify to anything in court if there is nt enough evidence from physical evidence and from people who choose to testify then that just suck
AH if you had any integrity you would acknowledge that your entire op is simply a string of urban legend conspiracy theory and plain personal ignorance you simply did nt have the fact when you wrote that op and now you do what are you are going to do with what you supposedly have learned in this thread
NONE if the op want to clarify their word they can with no malice taken the number of people posting subject or even text that they later say they did nt mean it that way is quite high here in my experience but it serf no purpose to leave such a claim unremarked upon now if they read it they can have an opportunity to learn if they wish

AH evolution being real is far le than the whole claim what you meant wa evolution is real and the human evolution make certain group of people psychologically predisposed to certain trait that s a much more specif and much more controversial claim than the only assumption is evolution being real that s a big leap and is nt really supported a for bias it s a hilarious misstep to say that only those who discredit ep have a conflict of interest when of those who believe it use it to reinforce their own prejudice again i did not say that only those who discredit ep have a conflict of interest i said i cited the blank slate theorist because they are the most vocal and they have blatant conflict of interest it wa you who asked me why i cited them that wa part of my answer also human being are a product of evolution so it is not unreasonable to infer that our psychological predisposition have or may have also been affected by evolution that s why the field exists at all and it is taught at university nevertheless the case still ha to be made and evidence still ha to be presented that s what ep doe but like all science it doe not have all the answer it is a process of constant discovery
NONE i have seen absolutely no evidence that he ha again changed the law if he had then he would have made that clear ok well you have to just stop here there s been no evidence of anything you re saying i mean if you want to argue this or that about your religion that s one thing but we need to be perfectly clear that religion is ipso facto belief in the absence of proof the argument it s not the s anymore is a metaphor it ha nothing to do with the temporality of religion what people are actually saying is the longer you go on in modern society the fewer excuse you can have for clinging to a religious belief in the face of evidence that directly contradicts those belief in the most recent few decade education in general ha increased rapidly people are exposed to thing they were not exposed to in the s the vast majority of people had never even heard of thing like radiocarbon dating the argument is essentially saying you are an educated participant in modern society how can you still believe the bible is literally true and that is a perfectly reasonable argument

NONE hate is a loaded word i do nt use it sexism is nt a level below misogyny sexism mean make a distinction between sex where is nt needed misogyny to be sexist and having the woman get to short stick about it you just accused woman of cheating more than men embedding in them a negative feature it pretty much fill the definition of misogyny which root all the way back to greek and roman mythology where woman were portrayed a illintentioned sneaking and cheater i m not willing to go to war about this thou
AH lol i bet you d need conclusive evidence to believe the earth wa round too you sound like the kind of parent who refuse to vaccinate their kid due to evidence of them not causing autism being inconclusive
NONE if parent are the primary then they do have to have some right to say they re my child they might be wrong in doing so but the statement itself is not illegitimate unless you claim the community s right exceeds the parent

NONE i just feel would nt it just be better to ignore him not from their perspective if you re against his candidacy and have a choice between leaving him alone and disrupting his narrative you disrupt his narrative no question i suppose i should add i feel like trump is pandering to his demographic and doe nt actually believe half the shit coming out of mouth that s not a wise assumption if you fail to hold people accountable for what they say and always give them a benefit of the doubt that let them not really mean what they say you risk reaching a point where you find out they actually did mean what they said and with nobody to blame for the consequence but yourself
AH are you fucking retarded i have been civil through out before you started yelling like a fucking moron in case you re too dumb to realize i am op and i am a feminist you yell without raising point without understanding what i m saying and are hateful in general are you honestly surprised people do nt want to be associated with feminist go eat a boot

NONE so your claim is not a strong thesis in that the assertion are not welldefined specifically what you consider a large percentage i hope you will consider updating your post to create a more concrete boundary i will start the conversation however by suggesting that a majority of woman are in favor of female registration for the selective service http thehillcompolicydefensepollmajorityofamericanssupportwomeninmilitarydraft this is to be fair only one poll but i am interested to know if it meet your criterion to undermine the point about the female draft
AH kid and i say this with the utmost respect get your head out of your as you re not much smarter than the rest of u you talk about democracy only allowed by an intelligent ruling class but you fail to provide any actual data a to why that would work secondly who are you to judge have you met every single person on this country my guess is you ve seen some opaque statistic here and there and decided to extrapolate wildly about the general population thirdly founding father are just a flawed and dumb a the next person thomas jefferson and hamilton hated each other if they were completely logical a you think they are they would nt have hamilton wa an asshole he s always been painted a an asshole and it is nt until recently that we ve seen some layer into his character but he wa still a dick jefferson literally raped his slave he did nt see them a people he saw them a livestock motherfucker did nt want to end slavery because he illogically thought it would ruin his farm you think that american democracy should be ruled by a ruling class yet fail to see how many time that ruling class ha been overthrown given the guillotine and sometimes outright murdered by someone in the same class usually these flawed human always felt that they had all the answer if only they could just get the current power structure out of the way do yourself a favor and instead of reading these book about men who sucked themselves off read animal farm it s a great allegory for human being in general and it will show you that you re more ruled by your emotion than you think from your writing i m pegging you a a teenager go to college get a job do some growing up and then get back to u
NONE i think you re looking at the complaint though not all of them from the wrong approach the fact that people feel backed into a one or the other lesser of two evil choice every four year is enough reason for disdain a is but it is only compounded by a trend that seems to grow every election executive or legislative people are voting for a president or representative and expect them to be their voice in steering the country in the direction the people want these people get elected however and do what they see a right people are complaining about that not so much the man himself i never understood why politician told me how they felt about certain issue i do nt give a shit how they feel i want someone who will vote or in the president s case vetopass what the majority want but they rarely do and people complain is the complaining pointless no it get attention with enough attention change may come about whether it lead to an internal reform of how thing are done people voting a certaindifferent way or an all out revolution now to address specific complaint toward obama and the desire to remove him this go back to the idea that even though he wa elected he s not living up to the expectation of those who elected him if i had to buy a car and chose the best of what wa offered and ended up with a car that did nt run at all after a week i d want a new car just because the salesman said it wa great doe nt mean it wa or that i should be obligated to keep it tl dr complaining is nt pointless it raise awareness and may lead to change
AH the republican party is the party of war sure if you do nt count kosovo afghanistan libya or syria except for the admirable dissent of john mccain the republican party is the party of torture i remember how obama closed down gitmo with the enthusiastic support of democrat in congress and then definitely did nt start a program of using robot to murder people from the sky they are still opposed to marriage equality so is most of the democratic party virtually all of it wa against marriage equality year ago is year really all it take for a position to go from acceptable on the left to right wing hate crime they work at every opportunity to suspend woman s reproductive right i believe what you meant to say wa to prevent the murder of million of child i am prochoice but i have at least made the attempt to understand where the other side is coming from that you have nt they almost all support mass deportation of undocumented immigrant from central america except you know eric cantor john boehner and most of the candidate running for president they have started supporting the end of birthright citizenship and all of your complaint share a common theme they are absurd straw man that either massively exaggerate the republican position or ignore that democrat have essentially the same position that they do you are frankly a typically embarrassing product of rsocialism you are nt just utterly ignorant about the position you claim to oppose you re flat out proud of how deeply you ve buried your head in the sand
NONE i am no social optimist but i think that even if most grownup can not go to the optimal conclusion from the data they have in hand they can sure a hell tell good conclusion apart from bad one good promise apart from bad one and do nt just blindly follow whatever ideology they happened to live their childhood with were you around through the presidential election in the us i think it s unfortunately wrong to think the electorate can come to logical conclusion about policy and proposal without be influenced by ideology given the intense division we have in the country what half of the people consider good the other half consider bad because of their ideology if the dissatisfied one get a majority the whole previous branch of the government go to jail for the time they were in office what do you mean by the whole previous branch if the majority of people voted a dissatisfied with obama s presidency who go to jail besides obama biden his cabinet member his chief of staff the intern legislator who voted for his policy how do we deal with the problem of low voter turnout a it is only of people actually vote in a given election so we can not really say the majority outcome represents everyone it only represents the majority of those who were motivated to vote and people sadly are more easily motivated against something such that it would be much easier for conservative to rally the base to send obama to jail than it would be for liberal to rally the base just to give him a medal
AH get your head out of your as

NONE for starter whether or not an act is rude v acceptable is a subjective decision based on each individual s perception if a large percentage of people agree that a specific act is rude based on their individual perception you know that doing it is likely to be perceived a rude by the other party it s sort of like wavingacknowledging when another car allows you to make a turn or something similar there is no law that say you have to wave some people think it s completely acceptable not to however i know if i do nt wave there is a chance the person may be offended there are probably a lot of thing some people consider to be rude that you do nt there are probably a lot of thing you consider to be rude other people do nt the point is if you know something is commonly perceived a rude you can and often should choose to not do it also it is possible to be on the phone and have the transaction take the exact amount of time but it s very common for it to take extra time just like it s possible to text and drive without causing an accident but it ha become so common it s now against the law

AH all you ve done is highlight the fact that people would rather adhere to the idea that everything is nothing rather than something moral aesthetic any relativism they can get their hand on is more precious than any progress we could make with an established objectivism i ve already pointed out multiple time that there are objective fact about the world we live in i ve also pointed out the fact that the thing you re pointing to a objective is nt i m sorry that this hurt your feel because you have a need to be right about your stilted view maybe one day you ll accept the fact that you re wrong sometimes until then i ca nt help ya until you can identify whether ugliness is subjective or objective you ca nt have a discussion about the effect of being ugly ugliness is determined by perception and not everyone ha your shitty view of the world welcome back to subjectivity all of the comment here clearly show you that you re wrong about the objectivity concerning the subject matter and all you do is deny these comment to maintain your stilted view and that is exactly what is wrong with your entire premise you are not the arbiter of what or who is or is nt ugly making your entire premise subjective to every reader who interprets it tl dr i keep saying it over and over because you re not fucking comprehending the fact that you are wrong princess
NONE in response to this i would ask if one person deserves to suffer potentially indefinitely just to prevent the suffering of others now you re changing your argument you stated your view a being about the total amount of suffering in the world now you are changing it to be about right of selfdetermination and who deserves what right i could argue on these new ground but you should really stick to a single formulation that constitutes the view you are asking to be changed if you do nt you can keep shifting definition endlessly in response to each new argument well i am also quite a diehard antinatalist for that exact reason among others so on this point we ll probably just have to agree to disagree if your personal morality actually say it would be better for all life in existence to be wiped out then all i can say is that your view of morality is so far removed from what almost anyone else belief that statement about ight wrong which make sense to you have no bearing on what society a a whole would consider right and wrong therefore there s very little point in talking to u about it
AH that s not what that phrase get at in any way i guess that your problem is nt that you do nt read people s post but rather that you simply do not comprehend them nevertheless i will try to explain and use small word what i meant wa that if the op came back at me saying mean thing about my mother because i made some bad guess about thing she did nt say enough about that s not my fault it s hers i ca nt read her mind i do nt have time to read every post in every submission if she want good advice she ha to tell u enough for u to know what is happening to her did you get that or do i need to do a puppet show
NONE well the person who left the meat there could reveal what actually happened tomorrow a well so i m not sure how that fit either but anyway let s change the example to fit your criterion today i signed up to donate month to a charity it wa either one that you like or one that that you do nt and you will never know which the point from the prior example still stand i do nt see how it s possible to just force yourself to actually believe i donated to a charity of your preference to believe it you d have to be convinced to some degree that i did actually choose that charity but there is absolutely nothing here to convince you of that a i said you could hope so or pretend i did but actually believe i did that again sound at least irrational if not potentially dangerous
AH reported your comment i m done here you re clearly too stupid to understand anything
NONE you can have your opinion i m not denying you that but your opinion is wrong
AH that is the actual dumbest shit i ve read all week
NONE can i just say that that last sentence is awesome
AH seriously dude a someone who is in his i am separated from you by the length of experience in adult life that is equivalent to your entire life wait until your hormone slow down and you begin to notice symptom of aging then we can talk about life you are just a dumb kid you should realize that there are thing that even a year old ha to learn about life you barely begun and you think you know anything definition of youth stupidity
NONE the purpose of life is to enjoy life and not be a dick by that i mean help other s enjoy their life too you should care about the environment because a penny of your effort will save future generation a pound help them enjoy life too after all that s the entire point you re on team human man no amount of infinite nothingness and cold can erase the fun we had edit i do nt know what silly combination of word just came out of my finger but i feel like i just won the cmv lottery

NONE i do nt see the point in self driving car it just doe nt seem like something we need led lightbulb are nt something we needed but i m sure you can see the point in those right it doe nt have to be a necessity for it to be useful
AH you are ignoring these death entirely and have not proven that gun make significantly it easier to kill people i have nt ignored them i mention them explicitly if you dispute that it easier to commit a murder with a gun than by any other method then i think the burden of proof is on you pulling a trigger is objectively le effort than any other method of murder you havent proven the prerequisite that it is significantly harder to kill people even in the simplest sense it take more force to push a knife into someone else s body than to squeeze a trigger the u ha experienced a much larger drop in the same time period and the australian nfa ha been proven to be ineffective yeah that s why the number of mass murder in australia ha gone up since it wa instituted right oh wait no they went down you fucking ingrate these city have stricter firearm law than most european country but they are inside a country which ha essentially no regulation on firearm especially when considering that a significant portion of firearm sale in the u several percent are done using the gun show loophole no le than of gun death is accidental my apology i accidentally included the suicide in there a well although are nt you the dishonest prick who doe nt allow statistic in argument answer yes you are you moron shark kill that many people each year let kill all shark no let s just prevent people from owning shark a pet or opencarrying them down at the local beach because encouraging people to hang themselves isnt a solution what the fuck are you talking about
NONE a couple of point here most gun used in the commission of a crime are obtained illegally some estimate a high a concealed and open carry advocate in general are very serious about complying with the law are knowledgable about gun safety and are responsible with gun requiring training although it is nt necessarily a bad idea is likely not going to dissuade joe schmoe from carrying a gun without training if he is the kind of person who is going to whip out a gun during a heated argument do you have any support for the idea that people are pulling out their gun when they feel threatened and this leading to gun homicide on any significant scale the data you cite is not specific to gun homicide according to a study by newsweek in citizen who shot in self defense were found to have shot an innocent person only of the time for police that number is so the idea that people are needlessly escalating because of lack of training doe nt really hold up according to the data we have about it not that it make those acceptable but just to give you a sense of the number i have no problem with some amount of training to get a carry permit because clearly it is a big responsibility but i do nt think it need to be a full military bootcamp i think your point come more from an emotional standpoint that you do nt like the idea of people carrying around gun because of the hypothetical scenario you have created but i do nt think there is much support that this actually happens edit formatting still not sure how indented list work
AH aww wa your safe space violated i m sorry
NONE i want to cry i agree with this so much
AH oh i m sorry i must have missed the point where the only rational objection wa explicitly eliminated why are you here then
NONE no but a noted it wa nt a a sever violation i m glad you were able to recover so well but i d never begrudge anyone who could nt
AH no i rank up thousand and thousand of point of karma normally the people agree no matter what bubble you build up considering the leak from the cia and fbi handed out by a whistleblower show surveillance by these and foreign organization and how nunes blew his as up for lying please do tell how the director lying about there the spying on the president is acceptable minor picked up and spread to every information agency on earth for research you expect me to buy that bullshit he should have the officer who collected and did such trading of information arranged to have accident mhm sure just like you said that every single day of the campaign that this one thing wa totally the end of him hell just looking at your content you post the most incoherent conspiratorial ramblings in history about how this one will truly stump the trump i m sure though trump is finally at an end nervous man for the time this month if the democratic party of this union wish to inaugurate civil war on this continent they need only continue their treason anthropologist oh that s why you are uneducated it s okay sweetie maybe you ll have studied something of worth rather than lesser people a equal better luck next time
NONE court have a concept called fundamental justice one of the thing it requires is notice and opportunity to make counter argumentspresent your case the reason this is considered important is that people make mistake all the time what if she said you are reading the chat log wrong that conversation happened last year i m not saying it did but what if or i know how this look but pussy is our slang for our coworker you remember i told you about her there are a lot of time in life when you are sure of something and a word from the other person totally destroys your case someone you have been with for a year deserves at least the opportunity to redeem themselves if you made a massive mistake furthermore in human interaction you can never underestimate the power of an apology had you confronted her and you were right and she apologized to you you could well feel significantly better about the situation or be carrying around le baggage in the future because of this incident what if the shoe were on the other foot and a year long partner of yours simply vanished because she thought you did something guilty or innocent would nt you want a few minute of their time to try and show they were wrong or even belatedly do the right thing and apologize
AH how long have you been mentalpy ill
NONE i have been doe that help my case
AH lol of course you get butthurt and keep reporting stuff ca nt tolerate a dissenting opinion
NONE so you want the reply to be disciplined but you did nt cite any scientific journal yourself
AH one common thread i ve seen with progressive on cmv is that they are quick to turn emotional and tend to take thing personally they also tend to downvote dissenting opinion all of it added together mean they want to turn any discussion into a debate on morality in which they inevitably claim the high road in this way they avoid having to think critically about their conviction and instead summarily dismiss opposing opinion a unworthy and even go a far a to shame people for thinking a certain way ultimately it destroys any potential for intelligent debate grounded in logic
NONE i think one aspect to this is that the set of people who are vocal atheist is much different from the whole set of atheist many if not most atheist in my experience just do nt give much thought to religion and may not explicitly selfidentify themselves a atheist unless explicitly asked the sort of people who go out of their way to proclaim their atheism on the other hand are generally looking for a bit of attention or affirmation in what they re doing and will often be more difficult to meaningfully engage with outside of the term they wish to set
AH it s likely that you are misinformed then and that likelihood actually just skyrocketed now that i see you re a donald poster hillary is nothing if not status quo which contrary to all rightwing talk will not destroy the country if it ha nt for the last eight
NONE i agree that you should nt mock every trump supporter unfortunately it just so happens that some people that support trump more than i d like to think about just so happens to be a part of the radical neofascist right wing and they should under all circumstance be ignored
AH god your an idiot all market have boom and bust periodically the economy ha cycle you must be young but dae trump bad bernie good if anything trump is the definition of a successful businessman that know how to make money and understands economics from personal experience did you know trump ha written book on it too in and but people like you blindly follow whatever people tell you
NONE learning to communicate by speech writing sign language or what have you is way more important it s the foundation of society in every society all over the world how is critical thinking going to benefit you a a person if you ca nt even discus let alone communicate at all an idea with your peer how are you supposed to know what critical thinking is if you ca nt even read or understand what another person say to you
AH you re failing pretty hardcore here everyone except the crazy libertarian disagrees with you i d suggest you give up because your argument are supremely unconvincing and you re verging into troll territory
NONE totally agree with you but whenever i bring it up in conversation i ca nt get people to agree with me they just laugh nervously and try to change the subject to something more palatable
AH you ignored what they said in the first half and focused on the small second half that s the oldest trick in the i do nt wan na look wrong but i do nt have anything to say to refute you book i ve pulled that so many time i can smell it from a mile away go back and make a new comment answering their response and save face like an intellectually honest person would and ehhh i d appreciate it if you would get back in your box and not tell me albeit in a roundabout way to fuck off friendo telling people to fuck off is not how you change opinion especially after you ve been called out for doing something wrong i respected you until you made this comment
NONE so how can we change your view about this you do nt think there are people who need this advice but i can anecdotally tell you that it took several people telling me this exact advice before it finally clicked and i started acting more like my usual self on date for a long time i would take a girl out and then try to act like the person i thought she wanted me to be it took my mother father and a few close friend and then finally an actual date of mine before i finally got the message that i really should just be myself
AH i did nt respond because it s an idiotic line of thought except when you do sorry it upset you but you do need to grow up if you think you get to use gun to force a dialogue
NONE this is nt really the right kind of topic for this subreddit if you do nt want to smoke weed then do nt we re not going to convince you to take a drug you do nt want to that s a personal decision for you to make
AH do you really need me to give you the definition of what the word imply mean you can look it up yourself if you really dont know i m disagreeing with your assertion of what the ad implies you seem to have a problem with people disagreeing with you get over it and take your med
NONE yeah but i think you are underestimating just how much friend want to help you people like to help those hey are friend with whether it is emotionally or otherwise you should nt need to go into too much detail in order for a friend to give you dating advice you just need to ask the one who already know you well
AH awww i thought you didnt want to have a philosophical debate about comedy
NONE i m not part of that conversation only here to comment on what is nt an animal
AH the scariest thing to u right now is indeed climate change your liberal bias is sickening drone warfare and no privacy are the biggest threat
NONE all of u politics is so far to the right that our crazy joke politician no one expects to get voted for are pretty much your republican moderate love australia
AH yeah he pretty clearly misspoke unless you think he fabricated the story of his past you have to either be an idiot or a liar to not realize that which are you
NONE golf is obviously a sport i do nt think think even up for debate this might be against the rule but seriously there s no other answer here your friend is being an idiot
AH here i m jiving you a jift for your hard effort making me feel juilty for saying gif a written and not a some guy who want to make english even more complicated than it need to be this brings me to one of the most common argument for a hard g people will start listing word that use hard g a example of how gif should be pronounced gift give game etc but to those people i simply respond with my own list giraffe gin genesis etc i agree that many word have hard g but the fact that some do doe not negate the fact that many others have soft one without a separate reason to use a hard g i see no reason why the existence of the word gift should affect my pronunciation of gif except non of your counter example already exist within those letter that d be like saying cart is pronounced the same a it is but car is pronounced sar you list game but you wo nt find any word with a hard g followed by the a sound because then you use a god damn j gift give u the precedence for what gif sound like it is only logical and consistent to keep it the same why should i say jif when the creator like peanut butter more than a consistent language
NONE you should nt need them to look like you in order for you to relate and feel like them because that in itself is shallow narrowminded and actually a bit racist the problem with this though is that historically there are just a few kind of character monopolizing representation i find that interestingly very often these view are expressed by people whose story have been told again and again in western medium middleclassish straight white people it s very convenient for one to say that the status quo is fine if it already suit you i know this is nt the case with you but i do think it s worth thinking about if one doe nt need a character to look like them in order for them to relate—if it really doesnt matter—then what s the problem with pushing for diversity it should nt matter either way plus i also think it s important to note that it s not a simple a i need character to look like me in order for me to care rather it s i want to be able to consume medium and see more people like me who are nt only cast a for instance a cab driver or a gardener or someone who work in a nail salon or someone suspected of terrorism etc
AH it is totally within your right to choose whatever you want it is totally within my right to call you an ignorant twaddle picked from the louse ridden hair of a threelegged dog s cunt you ignorant selfish sociallydetrimental prick i hope someone murder you and steal your organ but yea it s within your right to choose whatever in the world you wish and totally within my right to judge you for it right are interesting also profanity
NONE this is absolutely correct somewhere in the world there is a mirror in this mirror is the root cause of this homeless person s homelessnessaddictionjoblessness your donated dollar ensures the panhandler never gaze into the mirror let alone find it if you care about the person asking for money and want them out of their situation do the right thing say i m sorry i do nt but good luck to you and be safe
AH what he writes while very brief is pretty much in line with currently accepted history but looking at your other comment on the history of confederate statue i do nt think you re here in good faith
NONE you keep swapping in the wrong word for similar sounding word homophone tiered their etc it go on and on in your post lol i m probably just being pedantic but i thought i would point it out to you
AH op just shut the fuck up you are wrong and uneducated on climate change not to mention something so basic a the scientific process
NONE so if you agree that it wo nt work on all people doe nt that mean that your view that all woman have their price ha been changed
AH sweetie ill continue this conversation a soon a you have a counter argument without using your feeling
NONE a a caffeine sensitive person i completely agree with your view and do not wish to change it
AH so no company in the last year ha lived up to your princely definition of innovative wow i guess that excludes john carmack s work at id software dude made the wolfenstien engine the doom engine the quake engine the doom engine and now he s working at oculus to solve huge problem with latency reduction for virtual reality that fucker spent the last year a a pathfinder for the modern gaming experience and you just dismissed his work like it wa going to happen anyway he s a legend who is easy to cite but there are countless unsung hero at countless company who have dedicated their life to solving problem that you couldnt even understand if they spent an hour explaining them to you in simple term you are completly ignorant of the incomprehensible challenge these men and woman have torn down to drive our society forward and your position is inherently disrespectful of their work the only way you can possibly hold your view is if you are a child with limited life experience
NONE while i understand your frustration this is how the world work not just collegiate class when you leave college and start in the working world your employer can put rule like this and others in place simply because it is their business and that is how they want it run i m a management consultant so i have worked at a great number of employeers and have seen variation of all of these rule in the workplace i have worked for company where you could nt even bring your cell phone in the building because the information they had wa so sensitive i have worked for company where employee could only use the restroom during lunch or one of their two minute break during the day i have worked for company where the yearly performance evaluation wa entirely subjective or based on criterion that the employee had no control over you say that you are an adult and that another adult should nt have this kind of power over you but the fact of the matter is that for the rest of your life this is the exact situation you will find yourself in
AH a lot of people are being asshole about this gender stuff it s entirely appropriate to call them out one is not an asshole for calling out an asshole for being an asshole for example you are not a dick for calling ukmar a dick if he wa actually being a dick
NONE yeah call them bigot but calling them a bigoted troll is nonsensical if they are just an as call them an as a troll already is a thing the real question is about finding out who s a troll and who is nt when portraying their belief online
AH alright i m going to explain this the best way that i can without making it too difficult for you to understand i ll break this down in easytoread chunk so you do nt hurt your head too much when reading this but you have to promise to try your best to keep an open mind livestock can feel pain present no danger to human conscious spider probably ca nt feel pain present danger to human invasive still no reason to kill them i personally just relocate them if i find them in my house algae really plant can not feel pain definitely not an animal no consciousness your logic is flawed and your argument make absolutely no sense whatsoever i beg that next time you want to speak up in a matter that you obviously have no understanding of please think about the thing you say before you say them
NONE so do you really think that all drug should be legal yes i really do while yes many drug are incredibly dangerous you have right to decide what you do with your own body a long a you are not hurting anyone else it is not for me to tell you what you can and ca nt do it s your body not mine it s not my job to force you to do what i think is best for you you do nt want to go down that road either also skydiving is not inherently dangerous there s just a very small risk of something going wrong and you dying just like flying on a plane more people died last year from both skydiving and flying than they did because of overdosing on marijuana in fact from what i can find literally no one ha ever died from overdosing on marijuana making it infinitely safer than absolutely ton of stuff i could think of
AH go back to school child your argument and critical thinking skill are in need of an overhaul
NONE you forgot the legitimate option to not work during their adult life and be supported by a partner
AH because the u is filled with people like you this is a global issue and the only example of terrorism you can bring up relate just to the u and specifically your world view is so narrow it a wonder if you can even see i reference the kenya bombing the yemen bombing the libya attack the madrid terror attack and this clown say narrow since your reading comprehension seems faulty today i will spell it out for you the reason people get wary of a mass influx of people who align demographically with an aqi terrorist is because they fear these people will commit a terroristic act a they have multiple time in the past year also instead of spouting more incoherent nonsense really go check what terrorism mean your irrelevant example describe crime not terrorism jesus christ
NONE on the topic of torture in your situation there is no evidence that the person a in question is telling the truth or even that you can make him talk by torturing person b torture ha proven over and over again to be a source of lie above everything else you are not saving people by not letting refugee in the only thing you are saving is your personal standard of living especially when seeing refugee on the street just do nt feel right to you like it is the case for many people the terrorist of paris were not refugee a u said and even if the one person wa a refugee a claimed a first how would your math work out you are indirectly killing thousand of people a these people are experiencing attack like on paris every day
AH the reason we should not switch to european tipping standard is because we re not complete asshole and we understand what it s like to stay afloat on the astronomical wage of hr stop acting like the debate over raising the minimum wage to a living wage should nt play a role in this cmv it just make you look like someone who need to die off before we can make any progress wait how old are you
NONE i guess the real question sort of becomes how can we encourage a fair wage for server when their value is well above minimum wage yet we live in a society in which tipping is the norm it seems unlikely we would legislate a separate minimum wage for server whatever the answer is i just find it hard to imagine that reducing server wage by not tipping when they do a decent job of course is going to do anything to change the culture
AH what is wrong with supremacism racism etc go back to stormfront klansman
NONE most mras used to be feminist bwahahahahahaha oh you re good
AH i really hate people like you you force u to want to compulsively write everything down a they happen so that we can copy and paste it for people like you luckily it really not that hard to find a compilation of her lyingflopping immigration gay marriage tpp are the that come in to my head and btw those are all flop let me get a quote in here “ marriage ha got historic religious and moral content that go back to the beginning of time and i think a marriage is a a marriage ha always been between a man and a woman ” additionally in hillary stated on the floor of the us senate that she “ belief that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and woman ”
NONE lol that wa the point of the counter argument i brought up now since you accept that biology is nt the determining factor in loving a kid than is nt in conceivable that in some situation parent can love their adopted child a much a a biological child despite knowing the truth how about a loving married couple who can not conceive for some reason or another would nt having a kid even adopted make them the happiest couple ever and love the kid a much a a biological one again i m not saying it s the case for every single adopted kid but since you chose to phrase your view with a universality to it all i need is to demonstrate one counter example to cyv right
AH the definition of torture in the un convention against torture is actually contained within the un convention against torture no it is nt at least not meaningfully it say for the purpose of this convention the term torture mean any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purpose a obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession punishing him for an act he or a third person ha committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or a third person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity it doe not include pain or suffering arising only from inherent in or incidental to lawful sanction it doe not say if sleep deprivation is torture it doe not say if waterboarding is torture it certainly doe not say that making someone wear woman s underwear is torture go read the convention against torture and notice that intent to violate the term is not required for a violation to occur then go read about guy like this so then i assume you think that hillary clinton should be behind bar despite not intending to store her email improperly or are you just full of shit
NONE i think you might be mixing thought about what punishment are appropriate and what justifies punishment retributivism doe not come with the idea that punishment are harsh involve prison sentencing or any other similar baggage you re right alice doe not owe them a hard life or her head but that is not in conflict with retributivism nor doe it come with a you say fuck you i do nt care about you retributivism can oppose rehabilitation but there is no need to most retributivist accept other justification and consequence for punishment soft retributivism only push that a portion of justification come from retributivism and other justification are also necessary once again retributivism doe not come with poor treatment i think you misconstrued the retributivist commitment to proportional punishment from a legitimate judicial system the retributivist is not directly endorsing any legal practice and the retributivist is actually prevented from justifying punishment with well it s the law a within their position is an argument to be had of what constitutes a legitimate judicial system and restriction on what punishment are permissible again retributivism doe not come with an endorsement of a specific kind of punishment you can be a retributivist and only push for punishment like mandatory community service and you can be a retributivist for jail time but not endorse the current prison system a you can see in this thread on retributivism the position doe not actually make any claim about what specific punishment are needed or any claim about cruelty or claim that we should not care about people who commit crime
AH so by defending the fact that being trans is nt any kind of disorder or illness is the same fucking thing a being a neonazi who want to literally murder trans people what the fuck is wrong with you dude
NONE the reason i believe it should be disclosed is for the transgendered person s safety some men are very homophobic and while one could argue the reason for this it doe nt make it untrue i worry for the safety of a trans woman if a truly homophobic man wa put in this situation
AH by calling it black culture you re being racist there are so many different black culture all around the world even in the usa there are different black culture your evidence is little more than anecdotal you can find video of neonazis trump supporter and trailer trash doing all kind of terrible thing you need to look up different black culture because the truth is where you are saying culture you mean race there s just so much wrong with your post are you saying that every black person that is a respectable citizen is therefore part of white culture and no longer included in black culture
NONE i can state a a matter of fact that i become more alert around black people especially black guy who act hood i feel that this is totally rational given where we are at a a country and my own experience this is prejudice not racism and some prejudice is fine normal practical even associating people who do scary thing with scary thing is nt something your subconscious can help and ha obvious practicalsurvival benefit having bad experience with black people make you more wary of black people especially those who look like those you had bad experience with is nt racism this is different from racism which is a more conscious thing where a person hold idea about the validity of judging people by race that they have inherentpredictable enough trait belief that some race are better than others and so on
AH how do you write that much about nonsense rchan were just being dick if they are in fact legitimate spoiler

AH all communism ha no input from individual people that s what communism is actually communism is a stateless classless moneyless society there s not a single sound rebuttal the economic calculation problem because there are nt better way of combining dispersed and personal information than price that s because the economic calculation problem is a fucking wild goose chase invented by capitalist the reality is that it doe nt fucking matter unless you re already looking at thing from the capitalist paradigm from each according to their ability to each according to their need kind of doe away with your bullshit besides even if you believe pricing and market are a good way of allocating resource mutualism is unquestionably the superior economic theory ten of million of people died pointlessly because they believed what you believe you can try to rationalize that away but maybe you should just talk to someone who had to live through mao s reign or grow up in the ussr capitalism ha nothing on that ten of million did not die because of the belief in workercontrolled democratically organized workplace they died because of tyrannical authoritarian regime you and i and everyone with half a fucking brain know that the soviet union and maoist china had nothing to do with actual communism capitalism ha nothing on that really so all the war invasion death squad insurgency destabilization political coup etc that the u and other capitalist country backed those never happened el salvador venezuela honduras guatemala vietnam cambodia east timor iraq afghanistan palestine what about the atlantic slave trade or the genocide of the native americanscanadiansaustralians during colonization you re so fucking blind you know that
NONE personally i agree with you about all recent war but i think you re over idealizing all the war that have happened previous to your allotted time period i really do nt think any war in the history of war ha been fought in the interest of what is moral or because of any real ideal like freedom war are about greed plain and simple trade route commodity economy why would anyone shell out the big buck to go to war when they could just work it out and save everyone time and money who would kill over an abstract idea like freedom anyways usually the ideal of the people whatever they are are employed to make them feel like it s their duty a citizen of to fight for their or no one went to battle because helen of troy wa too gorgeous it wa more likely about trade route ww wa nt about the holocaust or whatever no one really knew what wa going on there until after the war wa over the united state did it s damnedest to stay out of it until it wa clear that our economy would be hugely benefited if we went to war and our trade partner were being threatened i feel that the idea that country go to war for freedom at all is pretty far fetched and is mostly about propaganda and patriotism but in reality all war are fought because it wa in the economic interest of that country now the people that volunteer to fight do fight for our freedom because that is what they believe in their heart when they go to war they are self sacrificing hero who deserve lot of respect is the war itself about freedom democracy or whatever no so in a way i agree with you but i chose to look at most war in history with the same lens a you are looking at the one that have only occurred in your lifetime pretty much no war wa every fought for idealism
AH so have you stopped beating your significant other or is that still going on

NONE you re not understanding what i m saying a person being a walking stereotype is objectionable because you do nt want to be seen a one of those gay people this is only a problem because there are people who want to stereotype you a one of them the problem here is nt that different people wear gayness differently it s that people want to treat being gay a a monolith blame the stereotypers not people who conform to the stereotype
AH black woman are a a group fatter dumber and more unpleasant nobody want to be with a dumb fat bitch i m a attracted to attractive black woman a i am to attractive woman of any other race but i m a unattracted to dumb fat bitchy black woman a i am to dumb fat bitchy woman of any race do what you want since i assume you re american but the problem people have is not with skin color but the trait that generally go along with it looking at your response to the rest of this thread i probably would nt take you out
NONE of course but there is a difference between saying “ hey nice ass ” and “ you look really pretty today ” or “ i really like what you ’ ve done with your hair ” one come across a sincere and the other explicitly sexual and probably overtly aggressive and a an adult you have to keep in mind the person you ’ re interacting with even if socially and outside of work is still someone you have to work with on a daily basis i ’ m no casanova but if i meet a new woman complimenting her appearance is one of the last thing i do

AH having a calorie range on the side of a menu option is intrusive is having nutritional fact on the back of your food intrusive because someone else ha food allergy do nt be ridiculous reasonable portion is defined by nutritional content and caloric value neither or which you can eyeball or estimate to any degree whatsoever anyone can easily see what is a reasonable portion understanding whether a food is reasonably healthy you ca nt possibly believe that line of b you just spewed if people had an intrinsic understanding of portion control and healthful eating habit then millions of people would nt suffer from obesity our cultural eating habit and our metabolic biology are hundred of thousand of year apart from an evolutionary standpoint people need education about what they consume so a to make informed decision to say that people intrinsically understand portion size is idiotic if you eat food you need to understand it is directly tied to your metabolism not divorced from it this requires a basic understanding of the calorie a a unit of energy and it relation to your food intake
NONE and yet if it really were a easy a force yourself to eat le come hell or high water would nt most people have done it already because that easy task is much more difficult for some people than you seem to believe for example the kind of food one can eat ramen noodle bulk cereal dollar cheeseburger is conducive to weight gain even if you limit your intake and a lot of people simply do not have the inclination to take time to manage that intake with the myriad burden of work andor family on their mind it is technically true that they just do nt want to badly enough but there are a lot of needs that end up taking precedence over that want our food system is not conducive to it our advertisement is not conducive to it and our lifestyle are not conducive to it the deck is stacked against the average person there s a very good reason obesity is a problem in particularly america considering the prevalence of hfc and the massive budget of food advertiser
AH you sound like an edgy fedora lord

NONE i understand your point and would probably feel the same personally however two point first it s a company policy so it applies to everyone in the company do you think that everyone would understand it the way you do and never decide to go to work when sick to avoid loosing a vacation day also if you re stuck at the hospital for week which let s pretend is the total amount of your vacation plus personal plus sick time would you be perfectly fine with the idea that opus you wo nt have vacation this year

NONE i love how most of the reply here are basically it s not because it s not
AH you think i wa generalising i ve read the comment and the likely woman are all insane being rude on this subreddit is bannable but spreading misinformation is not probably not the best ground to discus anything considering the topic

NONE if only there were more people like you in politics i do nt agree with you on many thing but your willingness to consider the other point of view and not to give a blanket endorsement to people is in my humble opinion admirable
AH like i said you should rethink your worldview contextfull comment because you need to babied through every argument or else you ll nitpick it without any real counter argument seriously you put forward gem like you did nt define a great many cmon even you know this comment is full of shit let me walk you through this because you have all the abstract reasoning and reading comprehension of a graphing calculator missing premise that decisiveness can be substituted for recklessness it ca nt that wa nt my point at all my point is that object traights are still precieved subjectively so let say that men actually do make decision faster than woman some will say that it make them descisve and that make them a great leader o it could also be viewed a impulsive or reckless making them not a good leader these are two possible interpretation from a single objective fact nd this is your best example your reason to straight up refuse to recognize masculinity a an objective concept you have nt even come close to proving masculinity is objective you have nt offered any proof postive or even dismissed any of my argument at your best you ve put forward empty unprovable bullshit like red equal danger go ahead and tell me what objetive masculinity is put forward a verifiable argument if it s so objective and self evident than i should nt be able to disprove your argument
NONE that concept make sense to me but i guess i do nt really get any sense of worth or meaning or joy out of challenge well i guess to me it s not really a matter of a joy of challenge it s a matter of if you are going to live your life you may a well make the most out of each situation even if it not challenging you may a well live it i failed i put all that effort into doing something and it is now wasted okay then you have to ask the next question so what you re still here and can still make effort this applies double in that many of the thing i care about and try to do are bigger than me if i try to do something for the sake of making the world a better place or helping those around me and fail then i view that a me being incapable of being a morally correct person morality is relative in the end we all will fail we will fail to be moral we will fail to be smart we will fail at love and in the end just fail if you feel to fail then you will never be moral your action will remain neutral rather than being sum good or bad and anyways if you learn from your action you can create a net benefit and help others learn from it

AH is this really what you ve come to i did nt distort what you said i replied and made my own comment based on what you said and there it is again the snobish i am superior to everyone attitude it s funny because some of the most educated people i know that went to law school and graduated with degree in political science ended up being republican in fact one of the head of the college republican at my university ended up going to harvard law yet somehow you re so smug and you have delusion of grandeur that you think that you re somehow better than everyone else and you ca nt see that this smug attitude is precisely what is driving people away from the democratic party the sad thing is you know i m right about hillary clinton but you ca nt just admit when you re wrong because your pride and stubbornness wo nt let you i mean you could be a poster child for riamverysmart
NONE i am slightly conflicted i want to feel empathetic but if you did nt feel bad when you took the photo why should i feel sorry for you when they were shown to an unintended audience and you could have taken easy measure to prevent it from happening imagine you re sitting in a bar with your friend your drunk and you go off on a rant you open all tap and you say what you think is funny you might say rude stuff about god know what but it s okay because your in a bar with friend and you did nt feel bad saying it then imagine that your rant wa suddenly watched by million people it becomes a very different thing i personally think you re paying to much attention to how it happened rather than what happened a young woman s privacy wa violated in a very severe way it literally became a cultural event the fappening raising money for prostate cancer etc it will become a part of the jennifer lawrence story it suck for her

AH that is for something far more tangible human life ask someone which injury he considers more compensable by money being imprisoned for five year or being killed and see what he say society doe not derive value from enforcing law against auto theft people who own car do are you being marxist disingenuous naive or all three doe society benefit from the ability of individual to own and drive car from individual not resorting to vigilantism to safeguard or reclaim their car from thief a the poor disproportionately face the justice system they pay more of the cost and reap le of the benefit disputable whether they reap fewer benefit if cop and court disappeared tomorrow theirs would be the first neighborhood to descend into warzones visit a lawless area of the world and you ll discover that rich individual and expat corporation fare better than the poor more troubling is that in the u over half of inmate were convicted in trial we most certainly would benefit from never having had in the first place you can argue for the repeal of most drug statute while still arguing for the practical utility of pleabargaining i do nt see how this is relevant making conviction cost le encourages more and le well considered conviction a high cost ensures that we do not use the court and prison flippantly a we do now ugh i do nt have the energy to engage something this stupid right now any satisfaction from making a winning argument get overwhelmed by exasperation at arguing such a point in the first place apology but i m out
NONE issue off the top of my head what if you re so rich that you live off of the interest on what you already have more to the point what if you can otherwise write off your income a then we d be hiring accountant to help duck criminal punishment also are we still on board with the punishment fit the crime if this is true then the increasing fine imply that earning more or producing more is actually an aggravating factor in crime do nt be surprised when a rich guy get to pay a shitton of money to mitigate his crime enough so that he doe nt have to do jail time farfetched now but consider this bribery might have at least some legal footing and consider this would also establish that the unemployed are more likely to commit crime after all they get a lower punishment now the unemployed get a worse rap when it come to probable cause and reasonable suspicion it s written right there in the law that they re le punished for certain crime or at the very least police will give the unemployed far le of the benefit of the doubt considering those suspect have le of a monetary punishment hanging over their head in sum there are unintended consequence when treating the rich and poor differently a the rich naturally have influence over their treatment while the poor naturally do not but the more the rule doe nt vary the more the rich and poor tend to remain equal under the law

AH you know this is a sub called change my view right you come in with an open mind engage in discussion and leave hopefully with a better understanding of the topic in discussion do nt get all bent out of shape over fact and science it is proven there is no way to argue against it
NONE i agree either you think the woman s right to her body is more important or you think the fetus right to live is more important to think differently would be in my mind hypocritical obviously i have my opinion about which of those option is correct but this doe nt seem like the place to go into it
AH thanks for the troll attempt for the bystander a real economist would be able to come up with a coherent reply that is longer than two sentence so obviously neither is this guy
NONE i wa about to write an exact same post and here we go you wrote it for me agree with op there is no way bernie would win against the republican candidate so a lesser evil of hillary is the obvious choice
AH op is waiting on artificial intelligence to come along and make sense of this dumbass idea
NONE i thought it wa rather funny and that people ought to get their head out of their rear
AH so you have a theory about a conspiracy that s cute
NONE what a stupid argument for a second there i thought i wa on rconservative
AH your ignorance is showing terrorist that happen to be muslim did nt just spring up in the and they certainly are not restricted to a single country let alone a portion of a country i would like to know how you could possibly imagine a lolololfactorx is anywhere close to reasonable we can get to plausible later
NONE no it really is nt your right to live in such a society where people do nt want to kill you it is the law that if a person actually attempt to kill you then they can be fully prosecuted but simply thinking of something horrible is nt illegal i agree with you that you would nt want to live in such a society but that s far from being a right
AH that s not what i m saying i m saying that if you didnt know that it s okay that you got it wrong but if you knew you were nt going off of updated information then what wa the point of your post even existing all i did wa try to bring it to your attention saying you ca nt hold me responsible for that instead of being open to the possibility of a correction just kinda make you look like an as tell me do you get this tilted so easily
NONE the thing i do nt get is this if you think that giving them money hurt them why doe it make you feel good and motivate you to do good yourself i think the part of your view that need to change is the part where you say it doe them harm i think you think it doe them good if you did nt you d be kind of a sadist personally i think it doe them good too even if they use it for crack i m not going to judge their choice because their choice do a fine job of that already
AH monogamy is not a need it s a compulsion it is not actually reasonable to end the relationship in the second case yes your common sense this is really really simple op your whole problem is that you do nt ascribe value to the same thing many other people do and more importantly that you lack the empathy to realize that other people s opinion can be valid even if you do nt share them you ca nt conceive of people who actually truly value their partner so much that they are happy to be exclusive to each other for life and want to match with similarlyminded people so you denounce their preference a selfish insecure immature illegitimate
NONE well i do nt think you should change your view you should continue to consider the greater good while realizing that you re giving up something valuable to you your privacy it s possible that something can be wrong in one sense but right in another sense in fact i advise using several value at once in this case you value personal privacy and bodily autonomy that s a fine value but now it s competing with another value you are prosocial that s a fine value too you also appear to value rationality i do nt know if this will help you deal with conflicting value but i applaud you for being so aware that you have them some people live their whole life in a black and white universe
AH this is one of the most annoying thing people who make stereotype do somebody responds with many example that counter the stereotype but the person stereotyping just responds with oh well those example are just the exception that to me just prof someone is being willfully stubborn and refusing to consider that their assumption might be wrong
NONE i think you miss that a lot of accusation of mansplaining are from woman who do not want to be disagreed with this is an easy ad hominem that can be thrown out to shut down the person disagreeing with them and an easy excuse to ignore the point they are making i do nt think this is always the reason people use this word but it is often like that
AH oh jeez i just noticed your username you do realize fanatic rely on faith no reason needed you have no basis for anything you ve been told to think philosophical capitalist oh please do enlighten me oh i mistook you for being deluded not unable to reason my bad a a consumer i get cheaper and better car now but i ll bet you bitch about tax and ca nt make the connection welfare for worker is a subsidy to the carmaker so just a well can be included in the car s price and the car suck because the obsessive pursuit of profit cut corner and you love it because capitalism i m glad that you re here to tell people what s in their best interest i never did you should know what your best interest is but you are more interested in the joy you get in seeing people suffer than in being human even some sort of martyrism in your own perceived suffering but to legally mandate them to do what s in their best interest according to the left it s called living in society a democratic society which you abdicated in exchange for your failed dictatorship now a plutocracy you do nt live on an island and you would nt survive there anyway you just want a free ride you moocher we know you are just parroting a prewritten speech what you are too manipulated to realize and is so obvious to the rest of u is how your position make all of u slave to your god how old are you
NONE how do you define dominant and how do you know what view should be held i m piggybacking on a few other comment in the thread but it s worth mentioning so what if a bunch of immigrant come to your statetown like a lot of them so much so that they outnumber the local if they re the majority should nt you then start conforming to their view and culutral norm you might say that you ve been there longer but i d ask about first nationsaboriginals being opressed in the same way another is what if a country belief all people of a certain raceethnicity should be killed is it unreasonable to try and convince them otherwise also where do you make the border for what are considered different culture town county city state country continent i think i heard someone else say the most populous state is california so should all of america conform to their view probably not and lastly what about refugee you do nt want them there they do nt want to be there neither of you want to spread your culture to them or have their culture spread onto you but if they re not there they might die so now their option are die or accept a new culture being shoved down their throat obviously one s better than the other but it doe nt seem very fair i agree with you for the cultural thing like behaviour expectation etc sure but when a community s deeply held view and belief are a threat to someonessome people life i ask you again if it s really unreasonable to try and convince them otherwise i just want to know where you re drawing line
AH you clearly do nt even know what my argument is maybe instead of ignoring everything i say and flat out refusing to use actual statistic you should attempt to explain why you seem to be under the impression that the absolute crime rate is so important whether or not a community is violent is pretty fucking abstract if you look at it in a vacuum like you insist i ll even take on the strawman you posted earlier the answer is fucking yes i absolutely think that white american are more violent than european and he data back this up of course you are still too scared to even look it up i had to hold your hand and show you that the bullshit posted before wa absurdly misleading and that the actual rate of violence is in a number that includes infant a in out of every black people you meet will have been convicted of a violent crime you want me to argue about in yet insist it s only to make some abstract point you ca nt make this same point with the actual statistic
NONE i think i wa getting off subject a little since i do nt know that we re discussing anything that would change any of your original proposition so i added the following edit to my last comment edit i m getting a bit off subject but you seem to want to rob your friend of any credit for her accompaniment and give it to her family under the guise of determinism but under that guise the universe is the only one that should get any credit can you not agree that she among all human should get more credit than anyone for that accomplishment even if in the back of your mind you believe that no human should get credit for anything in response to your comment though if i give a rat a button that delivers a shock the mouse will learn not to hit the button it is absolutely a deterrent to not hitting the button and it will absolutely work and it doe nt require any ascription of free will i m not sure how your fear of punishment comment is nt describing the exact definition of what a deterrent is
AH if you honestly think people not liking your screaming crotchfruit screaming is the same a racism oh boy parenting ha completely warped every shred of your logical thinking hate to break it to you but some people just hate fucking kid and are sick of entitlemoos and daddicts
NONE acting shitty towards someone based entirely on skin color is a shitty thing to do this woman did that she is a shitty person she and you are trying to deflect criticism of her shitty behavior away from her your excuse are weak you try to play word game but at the end of the day all you are doing is helping bad people get away with bad action stop it
AH rubber bullet are generally used for target practice because they are much cheaper and this is how i know that you know nothing about gun but even at a far range they will knock you out and incapacitate you no they wo nt rubber projectile are a pain compliance weapon which mean it will not stop a highly aggressive individual who can ignore the pain or who is under the influence of drug and can not feel pain they are nt supposed to knock people unconscious wtf what hollymood movie did you get that from and they are not designed to be aimed at the head doing so ha a high risk of lethality the amount of sheer ignorance you have in regard to gun lesslethal ammunition and police tactic is really obvious and i highly suggest learning more about the subject before forming opinion that are frankly stupid
NONE in case like rwtf and rmorbidreality sure if you have strong trigger you should nt be on those sub but sometimes the trigger is ancillary to the point of the sub and in those case should have tag a rfunny post that is something comical about spider should probably have a spider tag rfunny is nt a place that normally ha material that would trigger a reaction for arachnophobes and how much harm doe it do in rnononono sometimes death occurs offscreen a a result of equipment destruction some people care others do nt warning tag give one more area of discrimination for those people who do nt want that specific material ultimately you want to provide the best service for any given subreddit you really ca nt make a single morality judgement about what is and is nt appropriate speech for every single community
AH i think you re too dumb to understand the meaning of hate crime
NONE i agree but i m going to love people s argument against it

NONE yeah cuz you can never tell that a trans female is trans lol s
AH fuck off you rthedonald rat go back to your hole
NONE is this a straw man hot damn we re off to see the wizard
AH i m guessing that you think it s right that if you have a budget of million for people s wage then you should have one guy making while the other nine make k each personally i think it s better for the economy and for happy worker if all make in the k range i do nt think either should be the case each person should be paid according to what their value cost one guy might be worth and the other not worth a dollar by comparison what a silly idea is a ton of money in rural wisconsin especially when it s been shown that admin cost which include exec pay is in the range for private and only for public be sure to read the initial and the response at the second half of article that s not the figure you re looking for that s administrative cost that number includes so many fucking people that the fact that you re trying to use it to prove ceo take a huge bite out of your cost is not only wrong it s dishonest you re either an idiot or intentionally misusing number this is like saying that the weather channel is better than the weather service when the channel get a massive amount of their information from the wx svc for free and then add to it it s like saying that walmart is so efficient that they only need to pay their worker only hour when in fact they are relying on a massive amount of government service to allow their employee to house and feed themselves it s not like those thing not at all
NONE yes they can but this still cause a massive disruption to work flow the skill might not be available and the company themselves might not actually have the money to bump up people s salary by they need to wait for people to buy their product at markups before they pay people these increase salary but the people ca nt afford the good so they have to steal to survive or depend on government redistribution of the asset of the dead people but that take time and time is money on a national scale that kind of time is likely enough to bankrupt a nation also there is a load of retraining involved a well they say for the first month at your job you re generally more a liability than an asset i think many company will go broke during this training and recovery period even if they did manage to find enough new recruit especially if most of the customer base is dead that cause business to close down more unemployed people that have to steal for food total anarchy in total anarchym the guy with the biggest gun and follower is wealthy the guy with the ownership of coca cola is worthless perhaps your right in a perfectly frictionaless economy with unlimited workforce maybe the wealthy can just keep on chugging and the number will just get bigger but in reality the frictional force of wealth transfer will tear everyone apart rich and poor alike that is if the simple lack of labour doe nt just starve the country you can price a piece of bread at or in reality it s worth the amount of human effort it take to make it
AH well to be fair op never said that he himself is not an idiot edit this wa not meant a an insult this wa intended a purely factual comment op said everyone my age is an idiot http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsarqcmvthereisnothingwrongwithchoosingtobecsejqo he did not explicitly exclude himself from everyone
NONE i m not saying that i believe what trump is doing is right this is why it s important to prop up only the brightest best candidate in any given election what i m saying though is that charging him and throwing him in jail for treason is not how we operate in the usa it set a dangerous precedent your cmv is that he should essentially be charged with treason
AH lol dumbass op did mention asian lmao
NONE haha i didnt know people took this issue seriously
AH you should try introspection sometime you massive hypocrite the fact that you can not see how targeting random woman for having opinion they dislike is mysoginistic you re beyond help thanks for deploying the typical and fucking sad gger tactic of i m right bye have fun trying to silence peope on the basis of their opinion somehow causing selfcensorship while not seeing the irony therein
NONE i d shift that burden to you honestly in your op you state for all i know the reality that i perceive could be an illusion and there is no reason to trust any of my sens or memory it s not clear why the reality that i perceive doe not include your own thought i am pointing that out by saying you are observing having them not having them i agree they are the same but if you also agree why the special treatment for your own headspace
AH you are so naive wtf
NONE you are probably right
AH okay this is stupid then done wasting my time
NONE this whole argument is pointless i am just bored
AH no yours doe a study of transgender people found that per cent realised they had gender variance by age white matter difference could provide independent confirmation that such child might benefit from treatment to delay puberty this article make no claim about gender dysphoria with relation to brain structure in child it say that some child realize their gender variance and posit that white matter structure study could in the future confirm that there is a biological cause this implies that currently there is no evidence that child develop a variational brain structure that cause gender dysphoria since you put the ad hominem ball in play where did you go to school i m willing to bet my reading comprehension is significantly better than yours let s take the same comprehension test and find out pick one
NONE there is an argument to be made that true transgender people are intersex and not transgender due to a biological difference in brain structure however i personally consider that a hairy argument since you d just ignore the central conceit that people being mentally ill mean different thing said by different people not to mention that not all people who would benefit from sex reassignment surgery or pronoun use would fall under that definition in corner case eh it s perfectly possible to reconcile gender dysphoria a a mental disorder and a caused by an intersex condition after all this is already the case right now there is a fair number of intersex people who have dysphoria and transition all we would really have to do is add transsexualism to the list of disorder of sex development
AH are you a neonazi your link suck and show nothing of merit whatsoever there are no genetic difference shown between race when it come to intelligence that can not be explained through their region s education system or lack thereof
NONE to clarify your position is that because there is a system which favor those with established wealth those who do not have wealth should self cull themselves from the herd a life may be hard for their child
AH ignore this person message it s just some deluded feminist it s the popular thing to be hypersensitive nowadays making joke about race is the thing that is going to help u live together have you ever noticed you do nt joke with people you do nt like it s the same principle here i do nt get what she get out of calling you a heterosexual white male firstly you are assuming that since he is a person from a certain descent he can not understand certain thing if you ask me ubonyua is the real racist here secondly did you just assume dkv s gender how dare you
NONE i think that s worth it and do you own reddit this is not a judgement call that you are qualified to make reddit is not about politics or about changing view it is about whatever the hell you want it to be you want to change people s view too bad they do nt want their view changed your argument is basically just i do nt care if people s experience go to shit because i might make some people better in my opinion this is an incredibly selfish position to have you are not the only user on reddit
AH this post is ironic and i ve seen this irony before you say intelligence is unnecessary then in your post you prove you are not intelligent by showing you do nt know what the word intelligence mean that you do nt know word like cultured or educated you write your whole argument in one paragraph etc no it s not the ability to express your feeling that you need most it s the ability to express your thought you are correct that a person taste in music and literature is not an obvious benefit to them but that is not what intelligence mean intelligence is one ability to gain and use knowledge an example of this would be a man who could research the stock market then use his research to make money another example would be going to medical school then using this education to be a successful surgeon i mentioned i ve seen this ironic statement in another form this is very similar to the young adult who complain they were talk too much in school they complain saying thing like it wa a waste of time to be taught algebra i ve never had to use it in my career a a cashier these people are realize it but what they are actually saying is my teacher gave me potential i am failing to live up to i could have done more but instead but just a checker at walmart yes intelligence is useful but i m afraid you do nt know what it is
NONE you re getting hung up on the cooperative principle of language you seem like someone in university who s struggling with following enforcing and adapting rule it happens a lot with grammar happened to me mainly because i studied language it s like complaining that when you asked me for the time i told you my phone wa dead you understand what i mean even though my response could seem like unrelated nonsense but you do know what i mean this is what many people with language disability encounter like people with autism someone with autism and not to single it out might struggle pretty hard to understand how those two thing are related consequently notice how i wrote when you asked me even though we have nt met because that s how we talk british people might say one a in one should nt do that but it s just style which you should not confuse with grammar when someone say in norway we drink a lot of coffee that could refer to how much the country drink on average and it s a lot more than others that doe nt mean everyone every individual drink this amount of coffee and you know that one thing you ll have to accept about this scenario is that what might be meant is nt what s said yet you can communicate effectively without following what you think should be a rule
AH dr carson is smarter than you i do nt even know who you are but i feel i can confidently make that statement i m sure he did better on his sat and act than you and i m sure he can intuitively solve complex problem with given information faster than you can whatever possible metric for intellect you want to come up with i m confident carson will be in the because you do nt get to made medical history by being a dumbass
NONE i m secular and i will be fostering a belief in santa for my kid for one basic reason i think the lesson that my kid will learn from being told to believe in santa and then the subsequent realization that he is nt real is a good lesson yes i am your father and yes i could have made you believe just about anything i wanted so go out there and figure thing out for yourself kid you ca nt trust me you ca nt trust anyone to just tell you what is true or not
AH not just fat he consistently us coded sexist language cow pig slut etc after the moderator challenged him he called her a bimbo sexist slur and said she must have been on her period because that mean she s controlled by her hormone and is irrational silly woman when they disagree with me it s because they re incapable of being objective or serious take the incident when he called lawyer elizabeth beck ‘ disgusting ’ after she asked to take a break from a deposition to pump breast milk for her threemonth old daughter or the time he sent new york time columnist gail collins a copy of her own article with her picture circled and ‘ the face of a dog ’ written across it then there wa the aforementioned moment that playboy playmate brande roderick knelt in front of him during a tense celebrity apprentice final after a six second silence an eternity on tv during which trump presumably willed some blood to return to his head – he said “ it must be a pretty picture you dropping to your knee ” trump later told another contestant that she ’ d make “ a great wife ” http wwwnytimescompoliticsfirstdraftdonaldtrumpcriticizesmegynkellyoffoxnewsagain http wwwbustlecomarticlessexistdonaldtrumpquotesaboutwomenthatperfectlyprovethatthisguyshouldnotbe http nypostcomfiredloserslashsexisttrump http wwwtelegraphcoukwomenwomenspoliticsrepublicandebatedonaldtrumpissexistandhedoesntcarehtml please google what everyday sexism look like it doe nt generally look like someone saying woman are worse than men it s more insidious than that and it s le blatant
NONE michelle obama burned her bridge with much of the political right year ago when she said for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country http wwwyoutubecomwatch vlyyroegw it can certainly be argued that that wa a classless thing to say melania on the other hand doe nt really say much of anything i ca nt think of anything offensive that she s said especially compared to her husband the only potentially classless thing i could attribute to her wa lifting line from michelle obama s speech but that is more on the speech writer than it is on melania another angle to consider on your view is that some people may perceive that replacing michelle with melania is actually removing racism from the white house now i m not sure whether that counter your view or not because technically it would be about race but i do nt think it is racist in the manner you re thinking about with your view here http wwwdumbocratquotescomviewbypersonphp personid is a blatantly biased site with quote from michelle obama many of them could be reasonably interpreted a being racist or at least racially insensitive statement so if michelle is making racially insensitive statement and she is replaced by someone who say virtually nothing is nt that bringing more class to the whitehouse finally a rd angle on your view is that the statement is racist but it is sexist michelle obama wa certainly more in your face and willing to express her opinion than melania trump ha been michelle is the strong woman with an ivy league education while melania is the timid woman who married a strong man the people making this statement may perceive that melania is a woman who know her place while michelle did not but that ha nothing to do with race it ha to do with perception of how woman should act regardless of skin color
AH it s just a retarded argument i have no idea what you re going on against whether it be purge or the holodomor you have to be a little more specific than just chimping out about muh gorillion otherwise this whole thing doe nt really work
NONE you re just changing the gendersex scale to a more manageable three section category in which all sexesgenders could fit into idk what people do nt get i do nt necessarily agree with you but i think it s completely reasonable plus your attack helicopter example wa actually quite funny
AH hillary apologist are this desperate a president doe not have the power to really effect global warming immediately his opinion on the matter can not over shadow the deep corruption of clinton to make that leap in logic is more insane than denying global warming global warming is important but there are many more immediate matter that will come first
NONE it hard to refute something without making it seem like there is debate between two side by taking the time to refute their argument it make it look like they have point in the first place and give them exposure it better to make a documentary that say the holocaust happened and it wa terrible than a documentary that say these theory about the holocaust not happening are clearly false
AH i m starting to feel like a bit of a bully truth be told we ve been over this you re not very bright you re the guy that get the shit beaten out of him in fight and go around the next day telling everyone you won stupid people can never realise how stupid they are they always have so much to say about thing they know so little about

NONE so essentially we should fear the unknown a rational person prepares for possible outcome you do nt know if you ll get sick or not but i bet you have health insurance it s like saying do nt buy insurance you ll be living your life in fear so we should prepare yes absolutely the u maintains it s nuclear arsenal for precisely this reason getting rid of the arsenal would save money but if a war started suddenly we would be at the mercy of state with nuclear weapon it s not likely but it s a very bad outcome so we prepare for it rationally just like buying health insurance i m not saying we should nt be worried just that we worry too much which is worse than the issue itself i m not saying we should immediately repeal the thth amendment to prevent all terrorism i m saying that estimating the probability of event that have never happened is hard if some people have a higher estimate of the probability of a devastating terrorist attack than i do it s not because they re dumb what make you think the probability of an attack is so low
AH what you re doing is rape by legal definition from the wikipedia link you put in by googling but did nt actually read in english law the basis for such claim is very narrow hmm english law a in england huh well okay i ll be british for minute let s see we ll look into those twisty passage alluded to there were case of that broke a condition agreed previously wa used on aaand that s because of a law passed in that go figure wa repealed in along with polka dot thank god so conditional sex is out the window if you re british today not that it wa really applicable i see they also mention deceit a to gender which i ll assume is where you smugly hung your hat oh goodie to the sciencemobile let s see a woman pretending to be a man sound promising scroll scroll scroll blindfolded sex claim that he had been badly injured and disfigured and explained the chest bandage wa due to a heart condition scrolling intensifies and that he had to wear a bodysuit for medical reason and had to wear a hat because of a brain tumor well this is what shade of grey should have been i m hooked tell me more newspaper article gladly come the repliy it appears that the jury decided that the vitcim had no idea her lover wa her friend thus could not have consented in other word gender had literally dick to do with the decision it wa entirely that she used a different name not a different gender ball sir literally i crack myself up sometimes checkmate http wwwtheguardiancomuknewsjungaylenewlandfoundguiltyatretrialoftrickingfemalefriendintosex we still on for tomorrow afternoon at the club they re serving your favorite hat
NONE the post that you are talking about usually come up on fan subreddits thing like rbigbangtheory they rarely but sometimes come up on serious subreddits like this one the point of most of the fan subreddits is to talk and share stuff about whatever showgamemovie that they are interested in it is nt always to have meaningfulinteresting discussion but for the sake of argument let say that it is all post must contribute to an interesting conversation but they never really produce anything meaningful just people gushing about omg x is so amazing at first i wa nt so sure about this point so i searched rbigbangtheory for what is your favorite and clicked on the first link http wwwredditcomrbigbangtheorycommentszjbjwhatisyourfavoritemomentontbbt some of this stuff is what you predicted this is a fantastic scene and i know right but some of it wa more interesting stuff i agree i think last night s episode finally showed that sheldon actually ha some humanity inside and is nt just a robot deep down inside he really is a nice person but he doe nt know how to express it it sort of amplifies his action in the staircase implementation that yes he wa thinking logically but he s still a human being that care about his friend very much or i actually thought that wa a good move it snapped sheldon s character back before he got ruined and saved it from being a very special episode it wa just enough to make the point yet not lose the rhythm of the character interaction both of these comment contributed to a larger discussion that imo wa very meaningful i think that many of the what is your favorite post eventually contribute to a larger discussion that is meaningful in it s own right despite the fact that most of these fan subreddits are nt aiming to have meaningful discussion

NONE personally i think people should just not bother at all but that s just me my mindless entertainment is often television but documentary standup comedy ted talk movie it doe nt have to be downrighteducational but i d rather mindlessly soak in a good story than what suchandsuch celeb did when she learned that chad s been cheating on her i do nt think our time should be purely productive no and if tabloid and reality show are really your thing and you just love that stuff have at it it wo nt make you stupid but again there are other thing that could be making you smarter and which you choose to do doe matter in some way but yeah it s your choice

AH monsanto is banned in country all over the world this is false right from the start the company is nt banned in any country where are you getting this stuff ive never heard one good thing about them when i ve come across the topic from genetically modifying crop that have caused cancer and tumor in anima during testing and ruining neighboring farmer crop via extremely petty lawsuit i think you should stop reading conspiracy theory blog and start working on your critical thinking skill because once again none of these thing are true if you own a farm with a field of crop that happens to be near a farm growing monsantogrown crop you have the chance of having pollen from the monsanto farm blowing into your personal crop which they can then sue you for stealing their crop there ha never been a case of monsanto suing for accidental contamination not a single one why is a company that grows crop with pesticide and cancer allowed to have their product sold on the market let alone exist monsanto doe nt grow crop or cancer farmer grow crop monsanto sell seed all type of seed not just genetically modified to put it bluntly you do nt have a valid opinion that requires anything to change it
NONE do you have any evidence that these thing have actually harmed you like you said god only know that mean we do nt so since i ca nt prove cutting carcinogen and pesticide from my food would have an effect on long term health it ha no effect that s like saying if you smoked a cigarette you ca nt prove it s the one that gave you cancer therefore you are not harmed by smoking i do nt see greenpeace s antigmo stance a gmo scaremongering i think their concern about enforcement of corporate monopoly over agriculture via international patent law are legitimate golden rice is free to farmer earning under from their farming and seed saving is permitted so there go a major chunk of the corporate control argument and if their concern were about corporate control why is their stance on crop with nonge patented trait alexander hissting agricultural expert for greenpeace germany which is vehemently opposed to gm crop say the organisation is not opposed to plant developed using directed mutagenesis but will not promote it http wwwrscorgchemistryworldnewsfebruaryasp it should be just a bad a genetically engineered crop we ve got corporate seed patented trait herbicide resistance and a crop you sign a contract not to reproduce they only care about genetically engineered trait because that s the hot button issue that get member and money i honestly think the reason they re against golden rice is that they re scared it will be both effective and benign which would undermine their antigmo stance
AH your topic is bad and you should feel bad for not defending it this is a classic shit post on rcmv op post a topic asking for someone to cmv and then refuse to engage based off the rationale that the commenters hold the burden not the op
NONE ok but you are now changing one of the key reason for your argument a presented in the original cmv op that the family and friend should be happy for the person maybe you should revise this aspect of your argument if you now feel it s wrong
AH wow you are fucked up
NONE yes there is yours lol
AH dunno but go fuck your self pal if you want an example how about a mojority of military are southerner or the bbq
NONE do you believe this is true of only australia or do you have a idealize democracy but nothing on earth fit the standard
AH ah well glad to see you re not a closedminded fool
NONE listen no one is going to disagree with you here
AH i know sr us tongueandcheek and biting rhetoric but i ve never seen anyone there use racist slur call woman cnts or btches or use the word rtrd to refer to opinion they do nt agree with irrelevant i do nt care if you called me niggerfaggotcrackerspikhorriblepieceofshit it is the message that matter if you are saying word intended to bring a group of people down then you and i do nt get along sr doe nt use bad word but they do put down anything white anything straight or anything ci but all i ve seen from those three sub are safe space for woman and minority to talk about the crap some sub put them through it is it is also a safe place to be racist and sexist against straight white men you ca nt have your cake and eat it to it is either okay to make fun of race and sex or it is not okay
NONE people are going to be offended by what they re offended by unfortunately skin color is a major part of it i want to say i do nt care and everyone can use whatever they want and they can however a i am black that never stop the ping of cringe and discomfort and slight disdain i feel whenever someone who is nt black say nigga or nigger it s like if two jewish people are joking around about the word kike and then someone who is nt jewish arrives and us it with them or at them there s just a feeling of you ve never actually experienced the hurt and prejudice behind the word and people who look like you were or are typically the one spewing it out negatively there s just a lot of cognitive dissonance to overcome but sure you can use it and sure people can be disconcerted by your use
AH maybe that s because the gaming community ha a lot of bad people in it which is why we need to get rid of the word gamer what the fuck is wrong with you this sub is cmv and we are here to have civilized debate not debate fucking lunatic like you
NONE you might want to consider changing the thread title you re talking about whether or not a person should choose death over suffering which is a fair question but the title make it look like you re one of those atheist who say shit like death give life meaning
AH do you want your mommy to label your present from santa too
NONE ca nt change your view cause you re right and i agree with you
AH why ca nt they i m selling my house an illegal immigrant offer me cash for it i accept an illegal immigrant now owns land good luck with that paperwork just because they gave you money doe nt mean it s official you re right this wa clearly wrong which is why the us government formally apologized and paid reparation to those who were put in internment camp also this is nt really a valid comparison the us put people into internment camp there are million illegal immigrant in the us right now estimate vary detaining people is a lot different than detaining million especially when those were mostly documented citizen and thus were easy to find welp look these people are actively enemy of the state they re not victim they ve perpetrated crime against u all they need to be put in jail building and maintaining public road is a public service that is paid for through tax denying illegal immigrant the use of public service is more than denying them from using public school or welfare huuur i ca nt reason
NONE although i m not an advocate of religion in public school which seems to be what you re actually against a opposed to people complaining about public school in general i certainly think every tax payer ha a right to levy their concern and desire for public school to say citizen who are paying for a program through tax and fee have no right to make demand a to how it should be run would be endorsing a dictatorship you specifically targeting people who want religion in school is a pretty dangerous concept i do nt think the public certainly not of the reddit population would endorse that but if you start saying religious people who do are forbidden from lobbying their opinion of a public program you are saying that it is okay to silence portion of the population on any given program who get s to decide who can have a view and what view are acceptable you me obama fuck that everyone in the public get to voice their pinion on any public program it doe nt mean they necessarily get their way that of course is left to elected leader and vote etc but everyone s voice get to be heard
AH please stop there is another gap in your reading comprehension not being rude i just ca nt think of a more polite way of saying it and you are ignoring the initial gap that i already pointed out several time which make me think you are speaking but not listening the new gap is that you claim that a fruitless derivative trade doe not make logical sense a if there were a better opportunity for profit outside of a derivative product speculative trader would move their money elsewhere but the only reason i wa talking about a fruitless derivative trade wa because i wa replying to your post that said let s assume that there is a derivative that benefit no one other than the people trading it i wa responding to this imagined scenario for the sake of argument at your behest it is disingenuous and a bit insulting that you wo nt even keep up with your own train of thought and try to hypothesize me into gotchas
NONE well first it wa nt my commentary but way to pay attention op is saying that ticket fine in the u i can see we re still dealing with some confusion on your part so i ll repeat myself he did not say that he think this policy change should be directed toward any one particular country he just made the general statement that he think this is the fairest way to do thing thing regardless a i said before your whining about using an example from a country other than your own is nonsensical because it is rather standard in a discussion to respond to possible problem with a proposal that are raised by proposing additional tweak that might make the proposal workable this is a rather simple point so the fact that you re so invested in opposing it is kind of ridiculous the commenter merely made a suggestion about how the idea could be salvageable but this wa apparently too much for you i m sure we can all look forward to another rant about how other country ca nt possibly be referred to in any discussion without your permission though so let s get it over with
AH if you think the usa is a shithole you do nt know what a shithole is trust me you do nt know what the fuck you re talking about
NONE hi udxgypsy did i not respond to what you re saying in my comment it look like i did i responded to the claim that one is better do you see that
AH lmao you submitted a bunch of shit opinion piece i m still not convinced maybe once you re old enough to go to college you ll see your alarmism is stupidly misguided
NONE wow hey i never meant meant to offend you you seemed to take thing very personally i m going to go my way and i wish you the bet of luck in the future take care
AH so much bullshit you are just pissed because others slowed you down just like every other entitled driver on earth who is too disconnected from reality to realize it you are delusional and likely a dangerous driver you are seeing a lot of confirmation bias and projecting thing that are nt really there it s likely that the tire and the vehicle weight are what is having the largest impact in handling and traction rather than anything else
NONE the hardwaresoftware of the oculus is not a sunk cost because it is still patented and can incur a lot of revenue once you make it free you are eliminating your revenue stream there are a lot of potential upside a you correctly indicated but the cost would completely destroying their current business model i do nt know what their book look like but this would feel like a pretty desperate move and an indicator that the project is already dead
AH you made the case that the majority ha inherent privilege i agreed and voiced the only solution which is racial segregation so that everyone ha privilege now you are saying you want to end privilege by creating a utopia where there is racial parity across the board thus ending privilege so my solution is extending privilege to everyone your solution is taking away privilege from everyone the problem with sjws like yourself is they are retarded
NONE racial prejudice is the whole reason institutional racism exists it s a side effect of racial prejudice this is like you saying that the logical basis of racism is fine but the effect of people acting on that logic is bad the problem is that the logic is flawed the problem is that we ve arbitrarily drawn line down race when there are million other place where we could draw line that would act a more accurate predictive tool
AH it s the one where southern politician succeded from the union because they thought the federal government wa going to crack down on state right and yes the side switched republican were pro federal power and ultimately pushed through a blanket ban on slavery in all state and the democrat made several action in the decade before the civil war which would be considered republican in nature in the modern day these included fugitive slave law which required northern state to return enslaved individual regardless of their own law on slavery and a supreme court case which determined that slave themselves were legal in all state regardless of whether or not the state themselves banned slavery the republican on the other hand were more pro federal power and wished to halt the spread of slavery through federal action oh and both side were christian so back off the dur white christian ended slavery talking point also a an actual historian you re bit about dur hur read a history book is annoying because you were provided with a decent overview of how the republican party evolved but you reacted with anger and mockery you do nt actually respect the historical fact you only want to pretend that you re right
NONE i question the education of the voting populace not our current leader the united state population ha some of the highest level of education of any population in history and access to the entire wealth of human knowledge through the internet i think a method of impeachment should still exist what would stop a monarch from cracking down on dissent in your government for example the monarch could just declare war on any political party advocating hisher impeachment in prewar japan people who spoke out against the monarch and government were killed and imprisoned heck the sex pistol who wrote a silly song against the monarch were assaulted and stabbed and had their music censored and suppressed by the government in a free society if someone ha great power they have a direct incentive to u that power against those who would take it away hitler and the nazi party have preformed similar atrocity the nazi party wa supported by the kaiser german monarch because he thought it would help him return to power hitler is not exactly a good example to use in an argument about whether we should concentrate power into a single person in fact he show the exact opposite the danger of concentrating power
AH hey jackass try reading a couple other comment on the page before you write down really bad assumption that say more about you than anyone else
NONE i find it quite amusing that someone downvoted this cmv it even say in the sidebar to not do that because downvotes do nt change someone s view
AH how the fuck am i a bigot please tell what i said that would make you think that
NONE i ca nt say i know how to change your view on this one because i wholeheartedly agree
AH his point is that the expert know and we should blindly trust them typical leftist technocratic world view the leader of these country want the refugee to push their multi cultural agenda an occasional terrorist attack and higher cost is not enough of a deterrent
NONE in that same historical context it may have been the more pragmatic option simply to avoid the violence associated with an integration policy that s both widespread and unpopular having the trapping of a society is one thing having sufficient troop to constantly quell rebellion is another
AH sound like someone came to a debate board without the intention of debating like an adult
NONE maybe instead of trying to pick the perfect day why not hold election for the duration of a whole week
AH you re logic is absolutely insane so create a state ran fighter fighting system hire a shit ton more full time firefighter place them in every town in a state you understand the dollar amount behind that did you bother to look up what it take to be a volunteer firefighter and the regulation and requirement that firefighter go through currently do nt worry we will just increase unnecessary tax to do thissounds like typical liberal logic to me
NONE you ca nt just take any amount of time off if you do nt show up to work you will be fired you can quit your job and pursue additional education without starving to death which seems like a good thing to me but your ubi check will presumably be much le than what you were earning on the night shift do you think that night shift are only filled because the people who work them have no other choice that is nt how thing work now and it is nt a desirable state of affair regardless
AH hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha education ha nothing to do with iq you just lost the argument i am reporting you for trolling and blocking you
NONE i think the example i give summarizes my feeling perfectly but i m not sure how to word that succinctly the average homosexual ha the same right a the average heterosexual you re really overcomplicating thing
AH stop using such angry word and have an adult discussion please
NONE how about you just stop pouting and accept the result already
AH if you do nt teach them the wonder of outside then that s okay same if you train the for most normal cat once you put them couple of time outside you can not keep them home oh and your mother wa a hamster and your father smell of elderberry
NONE i smoke at least a bowl a day to deal with anger management and also the draining time my wife make me socialize i do nt see anything wrong a long a you do nt go over board just make sure you keep in under control and do nt let it take over your life
AH i wa being nice to start with but let s get to the point here the statement in your original argument is entirely meaningless wanting to lower gun death while paying no attention to overall death and crime is not only asinine but also completely laughable when you try and attach some kind of moral righteousness to it if you care about people and want to see le violence and suffering the only thing you should concern yourself with are the overall rate of homicide rape robbery or whatever not only those that were committed with a certain tool that you have an emotional agenda against with that out of the way your attempt at statistical reasoning is even more retarded comparing completely different nation and saying america ha more gun and more crime therefore gun increase crime is a level of bullshittery even the world s worst criminologist would not engage in we could just a easily point to switzerland with it very lax gun law relative to most other nation and it s much lower crime and homicide rate and say that more gun decrease crime this is using nothing other than your own logic would you concede that more gun le crime because of the evidence from switzerland the only somewhat reasonable way to see if gun law have any impact on reducing death crime homicide whatever you are interested in is to see the impact of gun legislation within a nation before and after change in legislation and i m afraid the evidence is against you the past year of loosening gun regulation in the u wa coupled with a massive decrease in all kind of crime including your beloved gun death so you have absolutely no leg to stand on to claim that tightening gun control will reduce any kind of violent crime seeing a the opposite is happening in your country and violent crime is decreasing year on year
NONE i think your analogy to medicare is inaccurate a having medicare will not affect you in any way besides the positive intended effect i think a better analogy would be gun law in the u the idea behind owning a gun is that hopefully you will never have to use it but just in case however what you have nt considered is that owning a gun affect not just you compare the u with a country with much stricter gun law such a australia have a look at their respective gun related crime rate and you see that australia is far lower this is because in the u every time another person purchase a gun they themselves might be safer but they have just made it slightly more risky for other people to not own a gun the more people that buy gun the more people that will feel like they need to it s a self driving mechanism which increase the availability of violent tool thus the higher gun related crime the exact same applies on an international level obviously i m not saying that no country should have an army at all however suggesting that any country should focus much more heavily on their military will just accelerate the growth of army everywhere and a higher availability of violent tool corresponds directly to a higher tendency of violent action so while your intention are to increase national security what you are actually doing is making the whole world a far more dangerous and volatile place
AH that s ridiculous first because no of the population want something a retarded a slavery second because the current system mean that if a welldistributed say decides against a worsely distributed they will impose their will so instead of imposing their will over we have the voter of a few swing state imposing their will over the voter of every other state majority rule is nt the best but it sure beat minority rule
NONE taxation is far from the only thing a government doe in your plutocracy the could vote to send the other to war or to become indentured servant etc besides the question of fairness obviously there would be problem with stability that s a big part of the appeal of democracy and why when established for some time democracy are more stable if you have a government that the majority find crappy there s a least a mechanism to change it yes i know it doe nt work that well in practice but it s still better than most
AH let s say you re in a boring relationship and your so keep cry about you re gon na break up with me are nt you relationship are not thing that you get into because they are exciting the world is full of exciting thing to do and if you re not doing them and instead relying on your date to provide you with entertainment and calling them boring when they do not dance to your entertainment it is not their fault it is yours insult aside from that the kind of lying you do in your relationship example and the small courteous word we use in common interaction with other people are completely different you should nt lie about thing like that in a relationship nor blame the other person for your personal problem yes being bored is not anyone el fault than your own insult but you should use small courtesy to signal other people socially that you are not their enemy but acknowledge their base value a a human being the reason we do this is because even though they so tiny they do affect u emotionally and everyone will end up happier if we show a little courtesy every now and then if you find yourself not wanting to acknowledge the base value of some other human being then perhaps you should try to grow some empathy and sympathy skill by trying to think about thing from other people s perspective pardon my insult in my message but i do not like pretending that someone who is behaving like an insult is not behaving like an insult and i think they deserve to know that
NONE in what way i d say it is ignoring the problem i am directly addressing the issue by proactively taking step to remove them from my life i have no idea why you think this is ignoring the problem when it the opposite of ignoring but you also do nt need to let their action affect you by removing them from my life i am not letting their action affect me i do nt know what action they are taking and not allowing them to act on me cutting people out of my life is all about not letting their action impact me i would say cutting out an abusive partner drug dealer etc is a very sensible course of action but that is nt what i meant could you please explain once a person fall into the negative category i m not sure why i should keep them into my life i simply mean ditching someone simply because they have what you view a a negative attitude could potentially be a kneejerk reaction negative attitude you are talking about negativetoxic people it generally more than just an attitude the article you linked to is about people who are beyond just a negative attitude no one – no matter who they are or what position they hold in your life – ha the right to infect your environment with negativity make you feel bad about who you are cause you to feel fear or hurt of any kind or try to force you to live the life they think is best for you you are essentially saying “ they treat me badly but i have to deal with it these are just more than a negative attitude
AH i m a guy and i m embrassed for you
NONE i m actually totally with you
AH this is immigration to find work if work is not found they leave learn economics also learn stuff
NONE this subreddit is just a soapbox for here is my opinion that everyone else already ha acknowledge me and my superior intelligence
AH thanks wa that so difficult you were being a prick to the prior poster simple a that
NONE a long a you re ok with their kingqueen being a legitimate kingqueen i d think it d be fine
AH book spoiler below why do people keep making claim along the line of this wa the first time one of our main character got tortured when she wa nt in the book so that s why people are taking to the internet saying it should nt have happened sure if you want to split hair than this particular thing did nt happen to that particular character at least not yet but the show ha to condense character in the book basically this exact same thing happens to jeyne poole sansa s old friend who at the time that this is happening is married to ramsay and is masquerading a arya stark in this way jeyne is figuratively standing in for arya here s a good overview jeyne is forced to marry ramsay and pleads with theon greyjoy several time before the wedding for him to help her and take her away when stripped by theon for the bedding numerous scar cover jeyne s back suggesting she had been whipped when ramsay asks her if she know how to please a man she reply fearfully that she ha had training jeyne spends all her time confined to a tower and is deeply traumatized by the thing ramsay doe to her the maid who bath her notice the bruise on her body and the girl s sobbing is known throughout winterfell according to lady dustin the cry of arya stark is more a danger than the army of stannis baratheon the frey may not care but the other northern house who had served house stark for generation do and morale is being damaged from hearing the cry of eddard stark s daughter http awoiafwesterosorgindexphpjeynepoole so yeah sorry something much worse than this scene though pretty close to it happens in the book to sansa s best friend who is pretending to be her yearsold http towerofthehandcomreferencecompendiumsappendixageshtml sister at the time so fucking different anyone that denies that this scene wa directly influenced by the above cited portion of the novel is an idiot cmv
NONE we ve had strong welldeveloped female character for some time now not a ton to be sure but they exist do you think ellen ripley would receive the same treatment just curious i think ellen ripley followed the weak to strong trajectory she wa a tough warrant officer in the company at the start but all the human were weak when compared to the perfect organism the first alien movie wa nt an action film it wa a scifi horror movie despite her pink fleshy human weakness a emphasized by her skimpy underwear she beat the scary monster at the end in alien her mama bear vibe is what made her strong i have nt seen the rest of the film yet so i do nt think she qualifies a a mary sue under the new or old definition she fit the weak to strong trope in the first one and she fit the strong mother protecting her kid trope in the sequel both of those are traditionally acceptable you can see them in everything from the silence of the lamb to the new mad max furthermore there are other part of the mary sue trope that rey embodies such a being well liked by everyone immediately for example why doe leia hug a new acquaintance first after han s death instead of someone she knew for decade rey did nt even see him die like finn and chewy you can sort of explain these thing and maybe there s a twist to rey s backstory coming in the sequel but it s a bit misleading i think if the writersdirector spent a few more minute putting in a word explaining this stuff it would be more palatable and she would nt have been called a mary sue at all a for poe i think people are willing to give him more slack because he s a guy they explained his skill by saying he wa a trained fighter pilot and plot armor plus he wa originally supposed to die right away but people liked him too much and changed the plot at the last second it s sloppy but it s been done before in other film
AH you are trying to rationalize the victimization of child you are a predator and i know your glossover tactic and i am not alone keep your hand off child you piece of garbage
NONE i do nt want to change your view your view is good and correct especially considering you re from the uk where american politics do nt even apply in your country you re a smart guy man
AH op is far more american than you ll ever be
NONE i wish i could upvote this more than once
AH since when doe this question ever arise out of pure curiosity over the nature of victimization the most relevant issue pertaining to victimization and your view is rape and sexual assault using car to postulate is a good proxy but car theft is nt a burning social issue right now i fucking guessed because you are bad get gud
NONE if the person is not of age then it is illegal to posse the content in the first place it doe nt matter what is legal and what not if you re speaking about changing the law tell me how watching video of child porn infringes on anyone s right in your dream scenario especially if the kid is nt alive anymore
AH do you not understand the term for the sake of argument or something it s pretty clear cut what that mean i made it clear several time that a death rate of an activity is enough to consider that activity a unlawful that s all that matter a this is the death rate of a duel to death what figure i consider the cut off point for all activity is irrelevant and unless you believe that driving smoking and alcohol have the same rate of death a duelling to the death which you d be a complete idiot to believe then it s irrelevant to discus and i m sorry you managed to interpret the tone of an angry little man from a piece of text i mean it is simply a piece of text after all short of using capital letter and expletive it s pretty hard to convey tone in text so i do nt know how you ve managed to come to that conclusion that s fine if you want to start insulting me though notice i never insulted you once in previous comment i merely said you would be an idiot if you held that particular thought rather than actually calling you an idiot based on how you completely ignored all other point i made and religiously focused on a throwaway point i used to humour you so we could continue the discussion a point that wa also largely irrelevant to the larger discussion and then resorted to insulting me i d say it s probably you who are the angry little man who doe nt like having their belief challenged
NONE not going to try and change your view a i completely agree with you and will be watching this with interest thanks for articulating it so well i ’ m not american but follow your election a they ’ re so entertaining the previous two had happy ending this one is a nightmare usually a candidate will be painted a terrible due to rumour straight up bullshit quote taken out of context vote they ’ ve made taken out of historical and political context and various other method all they had to do with trump wa quite literally show him doing and saying absolutely horrible thing – very little is out of context or twisted people saw all of this and just laugh it off ignore it or try do some olympic level verbal gymnastics to justify why it ’ s ok the absolute lie and topic completely omitted by the medium at both end of the spectrum ha me feeling completely lost a i don ’ t know who i can trsut out there i ’ m in my late and a pretty calm person but this whole thing is making me really anxious about what it mean for the u and politics in the rest of the world it s not even about what law trump will try to pas it s the tone and example he s setting edit i d love to hear from a reasonable person who voted for trump and not just against clinton whilst being completely aware of all of the above the meme and catchphrase spouting people in thedonald do nt really seem rational to me
AH bullshit read jefferson s letter to the danbury baptist america is not a theocracy you idiot
NONE if someone can still believe in that despite all the evidence against it welcome to religion
AH personal or societal priority personally i d suggest prioritizing improvement take a mental inventory of your good and bad quality and go from there on a social level you d have to convince me that portraying fat timid awkward or otherwise undesirable people a attractive is in any way healthy for anyone mentally or physically fat people know they re not sexy regardless of what internet activist tell them they might get a brief spurt of selfesteem from reading someone blog but thats a temporary emotional respite likewise attempting to portray some timid overly emotional jackass a a sex symbol is nt going to work all you re doing is patronizing these people rather than helping them i do nt know if this topic hit home to you and thats why you made it if so go do some pushup and put down the mountain dew you re obviously intelligent you just need to crawl out of your own asshole if not disregard
NONE first off if those thing were nt useful evolution would ve gotten rid of them by now i agree with you about being selfinterested this position is known a ethical egoism however being an egoist doe nt mean being a sociopath it s more about recognizing the thing you actually care about compared to what you re supposed to care about and the fact is whether you like it or not you probably do care about some other people and if you cause bad thing to happen to them you ll feel bad too doing what you want is actually much more challenging than it sound because a lot of the time people get confused about what they really want i think it s a mistake to help others because it s the right thing to do but it s also a mistake to not help others when you genuinely want to in both case you re putting an abstract ideal above your own will why should material profit come before your desire to be empathetic
AH you re rude and i find that to be unacceptable in a discussion
NONE you can give me a delta they re not exclusive to the op
AH well it might be that they identify a feminist the op never said those feminist speak for feminism or represent it accurately nor did she or he state that feminism is somehow tarnished by association with the supposed feminist a i ve said your issue can be resolved if you have second to read the body of text under the cmv title the reading comprehension expected of a thirteen year old an ability to take off partisan blinker for the aforementioned second
NONE your first problem here is saying a far a i can tell this either need to be a response you have strong confidence towards or not in which case of the latter then it need not be mentioned op can not state with full confidence say that their statement is true unless they can read the mind of other people thus in good conversation op ha admitted that they can not possibly know what the other is intending and then stated what they do know to be true which is their own interpretation of others behavior
AH and is pandering to the racist sexist fascist crony capitalist theocratic and just plain stupid portion of the population lol okay tumblrina indian mdphd student who s voting for the gop this november how are bleeding heart always so convinced they re right

AH it is a shit argument you argue about a half of a percent when that number wa nt even important to walruz s argument anyway youre just strawmanning away from anything important congrats we re all dumber for having read what you wrote
NONE then what are you arguing for that s exactly the position of most prochoice people lateterm abortion make lot of people uncomfortable but it s a judgement call if you re not yet convinced then what do you think would change your view
AH i ve done nothing but post rational and logical argument that you have not responded to so now i m just saying that you are not worth talking to it s not ad hominem because i m not insulting you to prove any of your point wrong i m insulting you because you are a bigot i can only say you owe it to yourself to wake up and smell the rose especially if you re a male hahahahaha
NONE the thing is i ca nt really see how your view could be changed i m not accusing you of not being willing i m saying that your view ha enough condition that it ca nt really be argued against i d have to convince you somehow that abusing a dire term to feel special or get nice treatment is fine and dandy and both you and i know nobody can really argue that your view hide a trigger are shitty but is only shitty people are shitty and there s nothing i can say to that last part
AH it s good to hear you did nt read the article i quoted or linked to
NONE my only issue with this argument is that i did nt think of it first
AH religion work because it us some of the cognitive distortion and imperfection of the human brain you are literally talking out of your as right now one of the consequence my point of view is implying is that it doe not make sense to ban religion from child only it would make more sense to ban religion from all the people who are not educated enough you know what s best for all the stupid people in the world you re smarter than them so you and your government are going to ban them from practicing religion those stupid people will literally kill you and your government just so you know they ll literally with gun will fucking kill you for their religious liberty i m just letting you know i want you to consider just for a moment that you are not anywhere close to a smart a you think you are i will tell you why we both must presume the other is rational if we do not then we are wasting our time if you re irrational then you can not be convinced of anything based upon my word and vice versa if you can not be convinced by any of my word then my word are a waste of time on you that s why however my presumption of your rationality is being seriously challenged by your last comment if you come back at me with something a egregiously retarded a the suggestion that the world s elite should ban religion from the untouchable then i m literally done with you
NONE i m ditching my normal cmv format to talk you out of this loser mentality and back into being your own person that image assumes that men do nt have value to leverage themselves with since you accept this and other men do nt the result is that only you come off a desperately valueless then the image really doe come true but only for you because woman are simply taking your word for it if you peddle favor and money to them they re going to accept it if your body language suggests you ll say yes to any random offer of sex then woman will take your word that sex with you is a worthwhile a the free shit on craigslist so first delete that image that some idiot spent way too much time drawing social manipulation always go both way you ca nt be a victim without also being a perpetrator the manipulator ha power but need someone to allow them control the manipulated allows control over himself because it enables him to shift moral accountability to the manipulator you have at least something to offer if you think you do nt get your shit together once you realize you do be proud of it and while you re at it get this idea of perfection out of your head because it doe nt exist i guarantee you the day you genuinely stop giving a fuck about what woman around you think is the day it start paying off for you a now you re the furthest thing from free shit on craigslist desperate also giving me a delta get you laid just a rumor

AH if you have a have something against cannabis or drug in general so be it you are entitled to you own opinion i disagree but i do nt mind but in a moral dilemma such a this it not a matter of your opinion on drug it s a matter of choosing over a what is honestly an outdated law and the health and well being of someone why you would choose a minor law which will rarely get anyone jail time over someone s health i do not know also it s only medication if it is prescribed erm no over the counter pain killer cough syrup herbal remedy and many other thing used for an array of problem and illness are nt prescribed yet yes they are still medication medication is a drug or other form of medicine that is used to prevent disease or simply treatment using drug
NONE i agree that cannabis should be legalized however my reasoning ha le to do with the positive or negative effect rather the idea that keeping it illegal is a violation of basic human autonomy a person s body belongs to them and them alone and they have the right to do with it a they wish or even destroy it should they please yes this also mean i believe in the legalization of all illicit substance the only time i believe a person s autonomy can be overridden is if they are proven to be mentally unstable and are unable of making basic decision for themselves or of course if they are harming another human being whether marijuana pose any health benefit or deficit doe not concern me in the least for i ve had no reason to try it a of yet
AH so you cite to a tv show and consider that evidence bravo i ve now learned that tv show are more relevant than actual human experience what more should have i expected in this age

AH the fancy western word for what you are is pussy
NONE i think this is the best counter argument to ops
AH oh please prove it i m not the one making the claim you are the burden of proof is upon you to prove that without government i would nt have had an education that s not hand waving it s about you being unable to substantiate your claim you consented the moment you turned and stayed in the united state wrong duress make voidable any potential contract pretending like this is a contract is just childish thinking it s not reasoned
NONE sure and i absolutely agree the stickiness and the public commitment are the core aspect it suit some people not others i just think that the it s bullshit line is a little unnuanced there s something about finding that person and saying that s it i ll look after you forever which make it an astonishing commitment and if that commitment fails it will be astonishingly painful perhaps fewer people should get married i m not sure
AH you must be the dumbest person here

AH i take responsibility for staying on a thread that could have spoiler in discussion but i m not going to take responsibility for someone choosing to spoil it for someone else on purpose you re fucking delusional i wa nt even pissed about the spoiler i m pissed about someone telling me i m to blame for someone else s action for someone choosing to be a dick to spoil it for somebody every fan of got ha acquired the ability to skim and skip and when they see name or slight detail that could lead to a spoiler they skip forward and read the next thing you re a liar or have never missed a premier if you say otherwise the book the air time etc all lead to people around the world to be in the story at different point the majority of the got fandom understands this and us etiquette to make sure not to purposely spoil it for others if i had skimmed over and seen the spoiler in another discussion that d be another story it happens but they purposely detailed a spoiler explicatly after i had said i had not seen the episode with the sole purpose of being a jerk period this is not a debate you re wrong and no amount of cherry picking or moronic metaphor is going to change that seriously a cornered animal lol pssst even if you do nt lock your door the thief make the decision to be a thief and so he is at fault this is why victim do nt share part of the sentence anywho you ve clearly stated your fucked logic you re wrong so there is no need for further discussion bye
NONE since each of your point is contingent on the others on a progressive basis let s handle the first if that doe nt hold up then the argument a you framed it fall apart if i m a criminal in gotham i m not going to become a supervillain especially if i m intelligent i m going to make sure that my crime fly well under the radar i ll hack i ll move money i ll operate without ever firing a bullet or throwing a punch for example it took batman decade to figure out the court of the owl and they were nt really forthcoming about it when discovered they kept trying to hide without ever becoming super in any way beyond being a monied cabal so at least one group of crook is directly disincentivized from the kind of dangerous supervillainy you re purporting a a necessity for gotham s criminal so any exception to your first point because of how you framed your argument invalidates your chain of logic if you had maintained some kind of severability between these point this would nt be a big deal but you did so it is edit fwiw your batman kill thing is spoton a is the rest of it people focusing on that point just seem mad that you do nt ignore retconned version because it harm the moral convenience their fanboyism is based on i d just ignore them especially when they have to lean back on pretending you re a fictional character too it almost seems like you set a fanboytrap
AH gosh what ha changed in the last year even the most ignorant and backwards country on the planet have smartphones and internet access you really think that ha nt changed anything you d have to be either wilfully ignorant or just incredibly stupid to not look stuff up that you do nt know and to just blindly believe religious leader in this day and age year ago the entire planet believed in various religion because that wa really the only way for most of the population to explain the world around them today there s no excuse other than cultural relativism oh that s right ignorance is just their culture fuck off
NONE i m not coming here to change your view but to agree with you i find it disturbing how a profession that largely revolves around killing other human being is treated with such nearuniversal respect i mean really i d be more comfortable if more people hated the military it seems like the military ha almost no true critic which is sort of disturbing it s like everyone think the same thing about it without question that soldier are all hero that they are defending our freedom and way of life etc with that said i do see the need for a military i just do nt approve much of the u military because it s really more of an aggressor than a defender
AH joseph kony and the lord s resistance army are hated by the whole world the justice and equality movement in sudan they are muslim wa reading hard for you growing up
NONE that s why i m only considering it but you actually are considering it you claim the industry which is all of tv is paid for by the government not even most of the bbc is

AH the music played at low volume is objectively better than music played at higher volume if the music at a higher volume cause pain wrongo retard why would you judge the music based on the volume you choose to play it on a music player
NONE but it s a false distinction music weave in and out of the movie popping up at the appropriate moment similarly the laugh on the laugh track are nt going continuously throughout the show they pop up whenever a joke is made
AH yeah they kept nothing from their culture and immediately became perfectly indoctrinated clone of everyone around them s fuck off with that argument i know dozen of muslim who have no issue integrating into the culture shit doe nt happen over night
NONE i believe that the biggest difference today is that the marine are basically only there to fuck shit up they mostly go in wherever they re sent and kill bad guy and blow shit up the army doe that but it also work on nation building and larger political strategy
AH important note bolding for emphasis not for rage would nt want you to think i m frothing then pack up and move shrug when wa the last time you actually paid for a move also nice way of ignoring absolutely everything that did nt agree with your strawman i agree there s no real point in engaging someone like you who conveniently ignores it when you give reason beyond well because he s a racist which wa never the argument in the first place mad because you re so intolerant that you froth at the mouth over a different opinion niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice completely false characterization i m sure the evidence will bear out that there wa no frothing again the frothing hashtag agreed with the basic premise that all life matter if you want to keep hearing that i ca nt really stop you also just no saying no racism is bullshit doe nt make me intolerant and it is nt just because it s a different opinion it s because the idea that someone is lesser based on the color of their skin doe nt hold up on it most basic level
NONE you just really wan na say nigga huh lol but seriously it s not racist i read through your comment on this thread and you likened it to race based exclusion well that s not entirely genuine race based exclusion would be jim crow law law that blatantly spat in the face of equality based on the color of one skin think of it like this your right to say whatever you want is not being infringed upon say nigga all you want but you can also call a woman a cunt in jest right like whatsup cunt you get the hw for last night see how far that get you with woman lol the short of it is this it s just a word the argument go both way of course but if someone feel strongly about it s usage then remember it s just a word you do nt have to say it this is nt affecting your life you re not being legally and socially disenfranchised because people would prefer you not use one word out of the entire english dictionary yes it s hypocritical but take other people feeling into account it s just a word
AH which is relevant how he didnt mention the nra in his post and gave the example of the slippery slope he wa talking about this is not about what every idiot say he already stated that he did not agree with the nra on that particular issue just because one trump supporter said obama is responsible for doe not mean that every trump supporter belief this and should change their view on the matter you are attacking a belief he doe not hold which he is saying he isnt holding but you keep on criticizing it that is the very example of a strawman you are not arguing against any view op hold what doe it take to get this through your skull
NONE i do nt disagree with you there i m really just taking on this one part of your statement the flipside is if he is nt capable of those thing then a good portion of this doomsday talk about the election is really overblown and it doe nt really matter that much in the end who get elected even if he is nt competent and ca nt do many of the thing he claim he can do he could still do a lot of damage his temper off the cuff reaction and misstatement during the campaign have shown that he doe nt give a lot of thought to what he say before he say it that could be disastrous for someone who is our chief diplomat
AH if their opposition doe nt start viewing this a a war like they do they will win it a they have been the time for understanding and compromising with people full of deeply dangerous antiquated ideal proudly disconnected from anything resembling reality is past they are now in charge and it very well may lead to the end of our civilization a we know because people like yourself do not respond appropriately to reprehensible word idea and people i doubt i will truly get through to you here but if there is another president man baby will start ww when it happens perhaps actually reconsider whether or not i did nt just understand what wa going on better than yourself i accurately pointed out it wa people like yourself abandoning their civic responsibility laughably in the name of compromise with and understanding of the xenophobic willfully ignoranant and proudly selfish is what got u here
NONE yes i ll admit short people do get discriminated against and not enough people see it a an issue serious enough to warrant any action which is wrong what i wa disagreeing with here wa when you stated no progress ha been made in combatting bigotry when it evidently ha but now you ve said that progress ha been made so that s all fine furthermore i do think woman and minority should be paid the same a their white male counterpart in similar role but i absolutely believe that if i had to choose between the two solving the problem is a better idea rather than just paying people affected by the problem i imagine lot of people would prefer it if the world stopped discriminating against them rather than simply receiving a paycheck to say working towards equality for everyone is futile and hopelessness and that we should just pay them off instead is counterproductive and not a good idea if what you want is to help those who are in pain edit typo
AH i do nt see a moderator flare next to your name so any post you make here is a part of the debate it pretty disingenuous to try to act all above it like that it impossible to tell someone else they are being close minded without also breaking the rule of this subreddit so please go eat a slice of humble pie you hypocrite i seriously disagree with your assessment of my argument and i do nt like how you think you have the authority to determine my post are improper while accusing me of that exact crime
NONE i d just like to say that a a canadian i misread your title thinking you were saying the opposite that they should nt in my mind it s an absolute no brainer that they should be allowed what doe doing something bad have to do with the basic functioning of democracy a far a i m concerned the law should treat the right to vote like the right to personhood if you are taking the right to vote away from someone you should be ready to say you do nt consider them worthy of personhood under the law
AH you sir in the simplest of term are a racist
NONE a you describe it this sound kind of illegal
AH again you are making more assumption based on some people who buy information for nefarious reason all company that buy information are inherently evil only purpose for buying information is to harm the greater society company dont buy information to you know be more well informed on the decision they make fuck naw that aint logical at all they are actually all criminal master mind trying to find way to fuck the world over it well documented that black people have raped people a large number of black rapist exists aa we speak in jail therefor all black people are rapist or will be rapist or serve to become rapist at some point in their life using your logic this statement is rational and hold truth in fact going against this would be hypocritical of you this is no more extreme of a situation then the one you suggested just a little bit more relatable example to the common man god people like you bring my piss to a boil
NONE i have to say i agree it s pretty crazy that we can find two conflicting thought to be true i d speculate that it ha a lot to do with how unintuitive these idea tend to be it doe nt help that choice play such an integral part of our life how can you be proud of your action when you are not responsible for them how can you blame the rapist and serial killer of the world for their crime how can we accept the notion of sin and what impact doe this rejection have on our religious belief our emotion and our conscious experience drive u to accept these thing a true while damning logic corner u into accepting the very opposite not gon na lie going from believing in free will to wholly finding it false is a really sucky experience anyways i have to get to class this is what you have to type in to make a delta the space is there to actually show the code so make sure to remove it
AH no i would nt if i were you you clearly have no interest in or ability to be self aware enough to learn anything go back to enjoying your facebook feed just keep repeating blessed be the mind too small for doubt

AH no need to make excuse it s acceptable to hate coon
NONE why would you want to change that view it s common sense
AH not until you concede that the aforementioned discussion is necessary i do nt want to get into when refusing care for a child is okaywrong only for you to say oh well this discussion is nt even necessary because x this whole thread is about that discussion because you seem like the type of person to do that fuck off with your ad hominem i am not currently asking you for your answer to the question when is it morally acceptable to refuse care for a child one ha conceived i am only asking if you agree that it is necessary to answer the question i think you should see a shrink for your delusion of grandeur you re not the bos here
NONE it is just a part of my past that i do nt feel is important or relevant to share emphasis added this is the problem and you re either going to get this or you wo nt when you re in a relationship it s not just whether or not you think it s important or relevant you need to think about whether she think it s important or relevant even if she doe nt you should give her the opportunity to make that decision for herself it seems like you re in a position where you re going to pay now or pay later later is worse because you re going to be paying interest on it
AH it s not in case of baltic specifically it is also a very recent response to a very specific political controversy and it will go right to where it belongs when the push come to shove and the push will not come to shove because congress will never approve it and honestly suggesting that u should kill ten of thousand of it citizen to protect something in russia s own backyard is the stupidest thing i read on the internet for a very very long while building on this point i do nt think i will even address the rest of your nonsense it doe nt merit spending any more time on it
NONE hmm well it would be either a communication issue or she s not being sincere and did it on purpose i do understand how rumor on their own can make your life complicated and ruin your reputation that s a very valid concern i m mostly focusing on the judicial part of it since you expressed your distrust in the system and the vast majority of those false rumor would nt even make it to court i think when it come to actual court we should give them a bit more credit in these case some people fall through the crack on both side for sure always have always will but it s an exception
AH very mature you ll do well on a debate board
NONE you did nt have to change my view on this one

NONE eh not really my wife doe charity crafting event a few time a year her main advertizement are flyer here s the thing yes we have the internet her target customer do nt frequent the internet much or if they do it s a few select site no one read them well some people do the point of flyer is if you print maybe people actually read it that s ok because they re dirt cheap and for your money you actually reach more people per dollar spent than a tv ad sometimes environment unfriendly when did we start thinking that paper a completely biodegradable substance is ruining the earth a vast majority of paper in the u anyways come from tree specifically grown to be cut down to be paper i mean yeah i see plastic coated flyer every now and then but the one my wife us are straight up paper wasting it is like saying we re wasting potato by making french fry and a for your last point you re right people hate them but not everyone hate them if you hand them out to people of them might think fuck off and throw it in the trash but those people were nt coming to the damn craft show anyways like i said flyer are cheap for the dollar amount you spend you can still attract a small percentage and come out cheaper than a tvradio ad
AH since you ve just insulted me i ll go ahead and respond in kind you re an idiot who ca nt fucking comprehend reality now then he did nt leave early if he started early otherwise that s called overtime which come out of the taxpayer s pocket that wa his point it may not be correct but that make him wrong not a liar
NONE what about the alternate variation of this thought experiment torturing the terrorist wo nt work because he s been trained to never talk but you have his completely innocent five yearold daughter if you torture her while he watch he ll eventually tell you about the bomb is this justified
AH you sound like a pussy that get scared by word

AH you sound like a donald trump supporter
NONE did he shoot a trump supporter that s le
AH you think being a reporter is just telling story jesus how condescending can you get
NONE so how is a picture good enough if you believe that picture can be faked
AH sorry are you asking why my heading did nt include all of the text my preamble did because it a fucking heading and not the fucking preamble it really it telling that you did nt take two minute out to read a couple of paragraph before you shot your mouth off like a child and you suggesting that i am trying to direct a conversation anywhere but where i stated i wa openly and clearly from the very start pretty much sum up the sort of person you are right there take a walk this is done maybe next time you ll read listen before you start sprouting out your opinion next time unlikely a that may be
NONE one that stick in my mind is that me and good friend went on a two week long roadtrip visiting everyone s hometown and various other city i do nt have a single picture of it to be honest though this wa a few year ago when taking photo wa not something everyone always did if it happened today i could probably freeride on my friend photo but if that s your plan then is nt the answer to your original question that it is bad to be a freerider you re getting all the benefit of a photographic record of good time without contributing anything to that record
AH if you want to run away do nt let me stop you so pathetic you re reduced to an ad hominem argument but i guess when all other defense of hamas fails you do what you got ta do
NONE i agree with you op i have no idea how you can justify letting them in after this if only terrorist get in who otherwise would nt have then it completely nullifies any benefit
AH going for the gold in mental gymnastics i see
NONE okay this one get to serve in the military
AH whatever you keep believeing your stereotype if it mean so much to you get some experience and then you ll realise how wrong you are about woman

NONE i ve never seen anyone offended at the term black who actually wa black you should meet my coworker their day to day activity include finding the newest race based outrage to gush over how stupid white people are and how superior being colored is i find it extremely uncomfortable to listen to and thankfully they dont ask me what i think i leave them alone and thats good enough for me but i still find it disturbing they even complain that nonblack people using the term black is discriminatory
AH i wa going to respond but you re obviously just trolling now nobody with enough brain to operate a computer could possibly believe something this stupid
NONE i agree with you and think they actually make the problem worse they think they are actually doing something by posting some bullshit instead of doing anything that will really make a difference
AH i do nt need a rebuttal i simply do nt agree with you you should try to be a little le condescending in your comment maybe then your comment wo nt be removed a often
NONE i m not going to try and change your view but i m curious what you think the punishment for this crime should be if not prison fine by your logic also would nt make sense
AH alrighty then first let me say thank you for responding with such a conceded tone condescension is always appreciated my belief is that he s in it for personal gain if improving the usa happens to go along with that how he s remembered in history etc he ll do it for sure this is kinda the whole point of my argument you have already decided that trump is the bad guy so nothing i say could ever convince you otherwise he could end up being the greatest president the u ha ever seen improving the life of everyone in the country and you would claim that he did it for glory this is gradeschool immaturity when your friend make a mistake or say something stupid you let it slide because he s your friend but when that kid you do nt like talk everything he say is wrong because you already decided that you do nt like him from only giving himself two scoop of ice cream versus everyone else s one you re fucking kidding me right he s fat he took an extra scoop big deal you re seriously grasping at straw here this is such a stupidlybad argument that you just further convinced me that i m right to whatever is going on with him and the russian which is what exactly you have no idea do you why would you even bring this up if you had nothing to say about are you actually trying to prove my point because you re doing a great job of it trump s backtracking on promise he made during his campaign he got the vote and now he s on to other thing oh you mean like every politician throughout the history of the u seriously kid study your history a little bit i m apparently one of those people who know absolutely nothing about trump or his presidency now that we both agree on
NONE considering you like the vlogbrothers i think you know how john aka uthesoundandthefury think of metaphores i think he said something like it s about making you feel how i feel i want you know that my head is exploding when i have a headache that a good thing to remember when reading any book really i have nt read other john green book than tfios but i really liked it i believed that hazel and gu could exist because john make such a big deal of driving home the point that hazel retreated into her book when she got cancer and that augustus wanted to be remembered so he tried to become larger than life but the largerthanlife ness is not what make augustus it s when his cancer come back and gu fight to stay augustus that make him a good carachter who carry around prop all the time so that he can make metaphor not someone i would like to know i think you are missing the point of gu he hates not being in control issac even call him out for it at the funeral and the cigarette is not a metaphor it s a security blanket it s his nervous tick no spoiler but notice when he put a cigaret in his mouth the airport and church stick out he is not in control and need to feel in control sure he might have chosen cigarette because of the metaphor but he could just a easily been whistling or snapping is finger cigarette are discreet because it s something a lot of people do you know besides the not lighting it part how many teenager have you met that go around casually saying some infinity are bigger than other infinity i know teenager like that autists sure but still people and it s not like hazel ran around shouting it she reminded herself that even though life seems unfair she can still make the most of it it might seem weird but that little sentence from her favorite book helped her rationalize her cancer
AH they harass everyone they link to dumbass especially if they have any kind of mra internet fame
NONE completely agree but you ca nt force people to have common decency or consideration for others now can you
AH why did nt you say if they are healthy enough rather than if their body is labeled a healthy enough it is such a weird phrasing it make you sound like a weirdo
NONE well if you say that the rightminded people will leave doe nt that mean that those left here are mostly the le altruistic one doe nt seem to spell good for humanity
AH i ca nt begin to understand what she meant by a pair of phrase that have no verb then you do nt really care to use your brain and frankly i do nt give a damn about what people say i care about how they act yeah and both your word and action are saying i do nt give a damn about anything but my ignorance and my soapbox
NONE ultimately it all come down to this you do nt get to pick what other people are offended by you do nt have to care if you do nt want plenty of people do nt but if being a little more sensitive of the need of others help them a little bit is nt it worth it it cost you nothing to think about how others feel but it can mean everything to them
AH wrong learn to read i did nt say a breat is more like a penis than like another breast in fact when i wa talking about that i mentioned that they are different i said genitals are a primary sexual organ and breast are secondary the point i wa making and i guess you just did nt understand it wa that there s no objective reason to ban any of it tit penis as anything so if you want to say tit should be allowed because they re not a penis well so what why should nt penis be allowed and the answer is because sexual immodesty is nt good for civilization i m not sure exactly where the line should be drawn but it should be drawn somewhere tell me why specifically you think the line should be drawn to allow tit but not penis freedom doe nt matter and it ha nothing to do with equality because you decided so by sheer force of denial no it ha nothing to do with equality because female breast are different from male breast you re the one in denial it s not sexism or inequality to ban female breast but not male breast because they are functionally different like how yet again you immediately forgot how the different modesty standard of the ancient greece mean female toplessness is not incompatible with modesty and still acted like it somehow weighed against it jesus christ is this a joke
NONE i agree with the idea that people get out of hand with the made up sexual preference and gendersex identity but i reluctantly have to admit that i think pansexuality ha a useful place whether or not you me or anyone else think it s appropriate or whether or not it s what the trans community want a lot of people consider transitioninged people or hermaphrodite either purely a male or female you may be a bisexual but that doe nt mean you want to bone transsexual people or hermaphrodite pansexual sort of open that up i d suggest that since it would seem the ultimate goal of trans people is to not be thought of a trans but to either be considered male or female it seems silly they should nt be included by saying your a bisexual but in certain circle i see how the term would be useful though that said i guess if you were bisexual but were nt attracted to trans people you would just consider them whatever sex they were transitioning or transitioned to but just an unattractive member of that sex i do think especially in the case of the very very few people who are born with or currently posse both male and female genitalia it s helpful because there is nt really a way to categorize them demisexuality is bullshit though

AH in order for something to be considered a mental illness it ha to be proven to in some way harmful to the sufferer having sex with other dude is nt inherently harmful killing yourself is pretty much the most harmful thing you can do you are literally ending your existence it s a dumb comparison if you are just playing devil s advocate i really do nt have any interest in continuing this discussion because your line of reasoning is flawed due to a lack of understanding in the basic classification of mental illness and disease if you honestly believe what you are saying well i do nt want to continue this discussion because you ca nt see the difference between being gay and wanting to kill yourself and that s dumb
NONE you are bi right what if i told you being bi is wrong this is exactly what you are saying if you do nt want people calling your sexual lifestyle wrong maybe you should nt think who they choose to sleep with is wrong i am assuming you do nt want to debate the implication of polygamy in term of the state regulating multiple marriage a your point relates to lgbtq in term of std being bi is more high risk a well but that should not matter it s your choice to take on that risk in term of the rich getting all date most polygamist today are not very rich at all and most people would probably not want to share so this would limit itself naturally
AH how about you stop trying to be socrates and actually state your opinion
NONE you ’ re going to fail to change my view that s not how you go about this
AH i m british so obviously i m not well versed on gun control in america yet it pretty clear of you look at this whole argument in it entirety op is clearly the kind of person that love to feel apart of popular opinion because gun control is a strictly divisive issue in his argument throughout this thread he seems to only want to argue for the pitfall of gun ownership look at the prohibition if the people want it they will have it that applied to criminal a well it already been said but this whole issue only come down to perception dumb leftist want gun taken away because they re mostly ignorant and want to restrict people freedom a much a possible
NONE a a nonamerican i agree with your reluctance to throw the hero word around so ubiquitously it seems to me that many american especially on the right deify the figure of the solider a a direct result of the militarized culture they re not even aware they re living within something pretty fucking troubling is going on if the kind of people who are attracted enough to the goal and culture of the american military to join up with it are celebrated the way they so often are a others have said in this thread i do nt think soldier should be vilified for the decision politician make but i also do nt think they should be seen a hero for getting paid to do a job that is ethically dubious on so many level
AH i m going to assume you are illiterate you have claimed that right are not earned they are an example of this is the right to vote in the u only one example is needed to show that you are wrong so it doe nt matter in the slightest what the law is where you live unless you believe that nowhere else exists other than where you live also you mention what right people should have no we are nt discussing whether right should be deserved we are discussing whether they are that s all there is to it also i m not american but it is nice to see you finally reveal your ahaha american r so dumb lol argument for what it is petty and incorrect
NONE hey op so what would change your view are you actually willing to consider the possibility at all that your view could be changed people have explained here why nice guy are a problem in case that wa nt obvious people have explained why calling them out and possibly even doing so on a public forum might be a good idea people have explained that if you say lashing out directly at another human being is acceptable which it is nt then you really do nt have good ground to say that these human being venting their frustration somewhere in an anonymous not individually directed way is unacceptable what do you need to hear to change your view andor why is none of that good enough
AH oh sorry thought this wa a reasonable subreddit but i see you like to ask stupid question to just argue
NONE ok report me if that make you feel good and i m not mistaken at all i ll look for the comment though
AH http iimgurcomuhjmtfsjpg
NONE http thefederalistcomglobalwarmingmostdishonestyearonrecord
AH your reading comprehension seems a bit low to have a discussion through text that s all i m sure it s not it appears a bit too deliberate
NONE sorry i ve had a bit of a stressful day so i did nt quite get the humour intended could i grab a delta off you a i seem to have changed your view
AH op think iphone is just a phone that can play mp or the entire itunes store is just like some random mp download website this is the level of perception of a thirdgrader
NONE the same way you do like i said your brain is just a computer made of neuron there s no reason a computer made of silicon ca nt think in all of the same way you can think
AH jesus christ i ca nt tell if you re being a troll or not trump is dangerous because he seems to have a very poor grasp of foreign policy he demonizes entire group of people like mexican and muslim he is demonstrably the least honest candidate in the election despite your warped view of hillary if you truly would vote for trump just because you re pissed you do nt get bernie you should nt vote you re a disgrace
NONE i do nt think your view should be changed here because you are right trump is a fat racist selfish probably mentally ill narcissist with paranoid tendency most politician do nt care about their constituent until it come time for reelection but trump is an outright terrible person my question is why would you want your view changed on this have you seen trump apologist if you spend two minute in rthedonald you ll see you re feeling are pretty much confirmed
AH you used two strawman argument two i never said woman are bad leader i never said woman ca nt do physical job then you proceeded to shoot down your version of what i said you re either an idiot or and asshole and i do nt have time for either
NONE i ca nt stand bar because of this ca nt hear headache ensur and like op said it just make me want to leave pair this with smoking that wa once allowed and it misery i think it really is an attempt to seem like they are hoping
AH oh look someone who ca nt read stop raping orphan for a moment and think the lifetime statistic method are never released and are supposedly derived somehow from the month figure any statistical process that is nt made public basically doe nt exist a it ca nt be independently verified i m going to guess they are using previous result from other intellectually incorrect study but because they never share how they arrive at this number i can not verify it correctness and therefore can be discarded even if the lifetime figure is correct it ha no bearing on current risk if the rate of assault for woman wa higher year ago this would be reflected in a higher lifetime rate but a far lower month rate current score me billion you negative infinity also stop raping orphan child and kill yourself you cunt
NONE so would you agree that grade should only be given in situation where they can be justified by the statistic of the measurement that are actually performed in the class because otherwise you re giving people grade that you have no idea whether or not they deserve a a a are almost certainly within these statistical measurement for almost any class they cover an entire standard deviation a commonly understood once you get down into the b s i m far le convinced that anyone actually measure accurately enough by the time you re in the c s i d argue that it s impossible to do unless every class session in the semester is individually graded and maybe not even then a for how you do it you just do it your view is that f s should nt have on them and indeed almost no school us those so extending this to other grade besides f s is nt unprecedented
AH yeah the deep down he s not a cynic then route is basically the equivalent of you putting your hand on your ear and saying not listening not listening i bowed out last time when your view became indistinguishable from that of a troll i shall do so again here
NONE my guess is that he deleted it quickly realized nobody wa going to forget about it and then decided to play it off a a joke to try and save face badly it s like telling a joke that fall flat and then defending it being bad with yeah but that s the whole point i swear
AH somebody just got a big dose of reality mommy and daddy must not be paying the bill anymore blaming capitalism is laughable
NONE yeah educate them that being gay is normal because parent will be just thrilled when their son turn out to be a fag good job america
AH yea that s why i said i bet no more accurate that calling people that do nt want to pay into retirement program they do nt benefit from sociopath you re just a liberal stranded in a centerright country and are pissed off huh
NONE why not make it so that there is no default and there are two checkboxes yes or no that way people actually need to consider whether they want their organ donated and they ll at least be aware of the decision that they re making
AH actually i can make your mistake clearer by quoting your first post here quoting me i would argue that if you are profiting but not giving back you are hurting others in society by taking from society s finite resource without contributing to make up for the deficit this argument doe nt stand up to scrutiny but i d like to give you the opportunity to describe how trading a derivative is harmful to society in a way that take finite resource from society this wa a fallacious post that i should have ignored or pointed out the fallacy in better you are saying that my argument doe nt stand up to scrutiny then implying i have a burden to prove something regarding derivative despite the fact that derivative were not a part of my argument this is akin to someone saying it is harmful to society to allow rapist to go free and having a reply saying your argument doe not stand up to scrutiny but i d like to give you the opportunity to describe how sex with minor is necessarily rape a non sequitur that can be easy to miss because it is topically related to the original argument well if nothing else hopefully i learned to pay more attention to the tangent of a thread and not get pulled down a rabbit hole due to someone else s poor reading comprehensionskills of argument
NONE i agree that this type of advice can be inappropriate if someone doe not understand a situation however i think it is a practical thing to suggest first it is a natural reaction to push reconciliation and forgiveness over hatred and disassociation even with limited detail our automatic assumption is that it is better to practice forgiveness than to hold a grudge we see the loss of a relationship especially parentchild a inherently detrimental second it is a constructive criticism if someone ha come to you to express their issue with their parent it seems unproductive to just agree and offer nothing if that is what the person explicitly asks for that s different but if they come to you with an issue it could be healthy to try to take another stance and help them resolve it or at least figure out what they really want to do third there is nothing wrong with challenging someone even if you must play devil advocate it is good to point out alternative option for people their decision to disassociate could have been very brash or spiteful if you can point out some thing that the individual is nt seeing you have at least provided them with another level of awareness and perhaps they will take that opportunity to consider thing differently
AH a an aside calling people stupid or dumb and comparing them to child is an ineffective way to change their view if that s truly your intent i am old enough to be able to recognize whose view can be changed and whose ca nt you need to grow up a bit to begin reevaluating your view but perhaps others wo nt be swayed by your argument knowing they come from a yearold confused about life
NONE when someone tell me they have preferred pronoun they become dude permanently if they push it they become asshole you ca nt force language on someone and still be the victim now if i m asked nicely a some sort of homage to their sensitive side or a special request to acknowledge their feeling i m willing to call them dude because life s not fair and the universe doe nt care about your feeling
AH ah yes thank you ulongknives is here with a valuable contribution to the discussion a always next time i ll be sure to check in with you on my level of information and be sure get your permission to participate in any debate you re doing god s work
NONE what i mean by the right time is if the subject come up in conversation it might not be the right time to start a debate about it and with some folk there is never a right time so you might want to get different friend for discussing and debating with
AH holodomor oh that one time when ukrainian farmer decided to hide ton of bread from the state so they receive fair shkreli kind of fair price on the black market and shot themselves in the foot in process afterwards marking it a genocide of the ukrainian nation by evil stalin but keep gnawing on the muslim dick kyafir i am sure they ll approve that kek
NONE that s a bad idea just look at the city with the most shooting death their state tend to have very restrictive law but are surrounded by state with very lax gun law so they just go to the other state to get the gun they want and then bring it back and use it for illegaldeadly mean there wa an article in about it with the number i ll see if i can find it

AH how did you earn your right to live in the u i m guessing you were born there if so you did nothing to earn the right to live there you just were really lucky when god dealt your hand do nt you think others deserve that luck too also the usa ha always been and will always be a country of immigrant your last sentence is really dumb imho there you give the exact reason why a lot of people try to come to the usa it ha always been a relative safe haven for people who otherwise are threatened in there home country like the pilgrim father on the mayflower also the usa is directly or in directly responsible for a lot of the conflict people are fleeing from today in the world so you have a morale responsibility to take in those people
NONE a lot of people in this thread have had a lot of great point but i also noticed that no one mentioned anything about the ada i work in the business and we have a lot of disabled individual come to my theater and not all of them are quiet or know how to behave in a theater we can ask their caregiver to try and control the noise and we always suggest that if it is nt working out that they are more than welcome to get a refund but we can not explicitly ask them to leave that is opening up a huge can of worm when it come to the ada it s discrimination and even though it is best for everyone else in the theater if that person were to leave a company can not leave themselves open to a potentially huge lawsuit
AH i ca nt tell you how surprised i am by this comment surely i did not see it coming at all you have bested me sir with your cunning argument that wa not at all the obvious route of someone with nothing of substance to add to the conversation
NONE two thing i wan na add i have a feint memory of a provocation that turned out to be an insidejob if anyone would like to comment on that please do i d also love to hear opinion from people who agree and what convinces you to hold the same opinion
AH look you shut down discussion because of a made up generalization fed to you by your peer you are the one that can not be reasoned with you are the close minded one you are the one refusing to discus someone is knocking it logic better close the shade and turn the light off
NONE yeah risk aversion is the symptom of feeling like it is nt okay to make a mistake just start observing other people let them take the risk for you see how thing go once you re out from under their roof you can start to take the risk yourself and you wo nt be so behind because you ve at least seen others
AH men and woman have different standard for hygiene this is just reality sorry your pointless world view on genderized bathroom is squashed
NONE so one rule for these set of people and another rule for these other people not really universal nor is this distinction in your view statement
AH what this is nut so let s get this straight if some racist asks to touch my hair because it s so exotic it s now on me to teach them that that s not ok but do nt call it racist that s rude you do understand how ridiculous that is right if someone said hey look at that retard over there and i said wow that s really ableist of you am i going to offend that person so much now that they get a pas to be a ableist a they like it s now my fault that i did nt educate them about how to be respectful i ll leave it to you to dispel racism by tiptoeing around it and getting out the thesaurus so you do nt offend the racist i m done with that eggshell nonsense
NONE do world leader think if they do nt say anything it mean we support it in short yes saying nothing about a topic is a form of acceptance if i complain to my pal johnny that someone cut me off in traffic today and he just shrug and ignores me that s like saying getting cut off doe nt matter enough to warrant a comment like it s something that s too ordinary and boring to talk about a more real example is when donald trump wa asked to comment about a kkk leader he did nt want to say anything about it and just move on to the next topic but it wa easily spun by his detractor a evidence trump wa okay with kkk activity so if you do nt say anything people assume you re accepting of it which is why world leader feel the need to remark on high profile topic just to keep their public image in line
AH excuse me you said if a person ha their bachelor s degree they are literate enough to teach that s what you said that s what i quoted and that s what i disagreed with later you specified without acknowledging that you were moving the goalpost that you were actually talking about a bachelor s of science in teaching that is not the same thing so you follow along fuckface
NONE cheating is what you and your significant other have agreed to be cheating so it s possible that two people could have an arrangement where one or both member can see member of one gender but not the other that s really not what your friend is arguing though he s basically saying well i told her that i would nt sleep with other girl and i m not because i m sleeping with guy so it s cool if you believe that your so would nt be ok with you doing the thing then it s cheating

AH i think anyone with half a brain cell can call you out on bullshit without siding a any nationality also you suck at trolling get good
NONE i should just give up on the urination example okay i think i should get a chance to cmv on this but i ll let it go at your request
AH this idea that any change is a good thing is profoundly deeply thoroughly stupid doe your doctor think like this your auto mechanic do you quit your job in a whim to shake thing up this attitude is at the very best a lazy excuse for not learning enough about the issue to actually decide which change or lack thereof are actually preferable it s one these fashionably shallow political opinion that let know nothing feel like they contribute to discussion without any real effort critical analysis or discrimination and yeah sorry your dream candidate did nt win but frankly that never mattered democracy is nt a personality quiz or a mall for you to consume brand in it decides the future of hundred of million of people and in this case of u election pretty much the entire planet nobody give a shit if you express yourself or feel good about your vote one of two people is going to win and if you re too intellectually lazy to actually make the call a to which is marginally preferable then the blame go straight on you when the shittier one win you want a personality quiz go to walmart and buy a cosmo magazine u adult will be out voting for our livelihood because we know that exempting ourselves from participation in the system wont exempt u from it consequence it s very impressive you re concerned about vague institution underlying our democratic process but a lot of people are concerned about getting food stamp job abortion bathroom access healthcare and a bunch of other real as shit we ca nt wait for x many protest vote election cycle to get protest vote in general might a well come with a big fat i m privileged a shit sticker
NONE yeah the money example definitely feel different in the sense that most people would agree that the organ are going to waste if you get buried with them whereas no matter what happens with your money somebody will get it it wo nt just rot the reason i bring it up though is that it get at what it mean to own something you can say hey your organ are going to waste just rotting in the ground but if you truly own something your opinion about what to do with it is the only opinion that matter — no matter how dumb that opinion is if somebody else can draw a line and say ok any opinion on this side of this line is too dumb at that point i ll take away your property because the way you re using it is nt good enough to me that may be morally justifiable in some framework but any way you slice it it creates a weaker conditional definition of ownership — ie you own your body and your belonging but only until the government or whatever entity decides that what you re doing with them is nt good enough you may be fine with that and i m not even saying it s necessarily wrong to be fine with that i just want to highlight that that s where your cmv logically lead i definitely share your feeling that it s completely crazy that thousand of people a year die every year waiting for organ many thousand more languish on dialysis for year waiting for a kidney that ha horrific cost both sufferingwise and financially my personal opinion is that the solution is to stop making it a crime to buy and sell organ http enwikipediaorgwikinationalorgantransplantactof that open up a huge can of worm that s too big to get into here but there are a bunch of old cmv on it
AH the movie is too flawed to reach a logical consensus on whether or not captain america wa a villain seriously i m done with this mickey mousetier soap opera drama it doe nt help either that all the fight scene are edited by a teenager with tourette s and parkinson s it s a if they want to distract the audience from how shoddy everything look by waving a flashlight on their face i could nt give a damn about any of these sterile excuse for character during the airport scene all the artificiallyinflated conflict devolved into a child playing with one toy in each hand and bashing them together it s riddled with sophomoric and shallow pseudopolitical ponderings that are thrown out the window when the quiptastic action start they completely disregard for the umpteenth time the collateral damage while they re having fun showcasing their flashy ability the third act pretend to get serious when in reality it turn into a cheap heartstring manipulation revolving around why did nt you tell me cap wahh this part completely disregard the fact that stark know all too well that brainwashing and mental manipulation is a thing let s not forget that he ha witnessed it firsthand with banner there s no excuse for him to have such a sudden change of heart other than to extend the conflict for another minute of mindless violence and leave the manchildren with the impression that they ve just witnessed an intricate revenge tragedy all smoke and mirror the constant quipping is an effective tool to cloud a fanboy s mind and judgement finally what s left is an entire team of worldclass hero that got fooled by a man wearing a bucky mask not to mention that the villain s stale trope wa better executed year ago when scream came out ironically a film satirizing this cliché if you do nt think this is cartoonish and laughable you might be too young to post on this subreddit
NONE so basically this boil down to you can not believe that ryan lochte an american swimmer famous for stupidity and an almost cartoonish frat boy relationship with alcohol and who had reason to know about the kiwi juijitsu fellow s experience would make up a bullshit story to make himself seem tough and also victimized rather than admit he d made a drunken as of himself and vandalized a gas station then never consider the possibility that his story would be checked instead you think it s more likely that some shadowy cabal trusted their shadowiness to that stuttering pile of wet muscle in a convoluted plot to have him first make a splash about crime in rio and then have his story immediately fall apart because this seems like the best possible way to improve the narrative of the olympic game even though any bribe or blackmail scheme could easily rebound when their chosen rube forgets he s part of a plot and brag about it in a vine remember most people clever and powerful enough to pull off a stunt like that are clever and powerful enough to neither want nor have to do that this doe nt even improve the narrative much if at all the narrative wa improved by low expectation being beaten there s still glaring problem with rio but that wa always going to be the case what there ha nt been is calamity which is what a lot of people expected this dumbass ryan lochte thing is nt going to matter long term and engineering it would be an utter waste or resource and foolish risk for little gain
AH you are kind of a dick you are contributing to the gentrification of the neighborhood and the economic reality that make it profitable for company to evict their neighbor according to you you do nt know any of your neighbor so it s not like you appear to contribute to the community a a good neighbor you are generalizing bad experience with black people to an entire race i ve bet you have had way more minority shitty interaction with white people but just blow it off a that person is an asshole not all white people are violent you think black life matter is escalating or causing racial tension in this country like calling attention to and in some situation fighting back against systemic violence against black body by the prison industrial complex the th amendment did nt end slavery it just gave that power exclusively to the state because upon conviction of a crime in the u according to the th amendment you are nt protected from slave labor so you think ignoring racism is helping tension learn some nonwhitewashed history
NONE i m still holding the same view i think we reached a point where screaming at police judge and people in power to stop being racist doe nt do any good it wa certainly the right move at the time of rosa park but now these subtle compared to yea ago stereotype will only go away if black community truly prof to the country that they are not violent with cold hard number the problem is where do the stereotype come from you are right that black people commit more crime but we also know that crime is caused by thing like systemic disenfranchisement poverty lack of job opportunity etc all the sort of thing that affect the black community more because of the racism in the system that i m talking about and the data show so the reason black people are screaming at police judge and people in power is that they are the one who have the ability to change thing that make crime among the black community more likely
AH what planet are you living on are you serious i ve watched this interview time waiting to hear trump say what you are claiming you are lying trump doe not say what you are claiming the only way to support that is either to lie or to imply something how dishonest can you be i dont have time to watch it again go on youtube and edit the interview to show me where trump say he fired comey because he wa investigating him unless you can prove what you are saying you are lying why are you people so fucking dishonest you are claiming trump said this but provide no evidence to support it because he did nt say it and you are lying wow so surprised the left is lying really dude you and your moronic rep are making the left look completely ignorant have fun over the next year of trump because anybody with a brain see right through these baseless accusation
NONE well here s my take brown wa probably being a shithead we saw him rob a convenience store on tape just before he got killed i m sure this wa not his first criminal act and it likely would not have been his last but do you deserve to get killed for being a shithead having said that at this point we do nt actually know for sure what happened it very well could have gone down like you suggested and then i would agree with you but some people are presenting a different story let s say he wa surrendering or wa shot in the back hypothetical would you change your opinion what if that s the only news you ve heard some people on certain news outlet ran story suggesting that would nt you be pissed too if you re black you probably feel like you re getting extra scrutiny for the color of your skin and then you hear on the news about a cop shooting another black guy in the back what would you think
AH they are subjecting themselves to the risk of murder by disclosing at all the fact that you think they have an obligation to put their life at risk is horrifying to me did you even read my comment you re the one subjecting them to murder do you think someone is more likely to kill someone for saying they re trans or for not telling them and then the person finding out later you re a disgusting thing you re not even a person
NONE you do nt have to feel sorry for the person raped in jail you may want to be concerned about the correction system if it let that happen people in jail are there because they could nt obey the law what make you want to give them the capacity to act in that fashion are you going to trust that they only do it to those who deserve it maybe it ll be the more vicious rapist who are doing more rape
AH you post on cmv but when you are clearly wrong you continue to argue you should make make a subreddit where you can argue with yourself maybe rihavenofriends
NONE if you want you can ask your own fiancee to agree to this and sign a prenuptial agreement to that effect but why expect everyone play by your rule what s it to you
AH she ha pushed for military intervention in no le than different nation since iraq libya syria ukraine that s just off the top of my head you are welcome to think that show she is a peaceful person but that just make you fucking retarded

NONE so the people selling thing do nt know what they are selling or that their motivation is nt to make money is there a motivation to make money that s not greed where exactly would you draw that line
AH with sexrape consent actually change the experience no it doe nt identical thing can happen and be rape and horrible or awesome consensual sex i emphasized that numerous time in my first post for precisely that reason surgery is the same physical experience with or without consent the same relationship can exist in sex v rape it just can and i find it patently silly that you claim otherwise i m never going to not have pain just because i enthusiastically endorsed the idea of the surgery beforehand same go for sex think about bdsm there are a lot of people who literally get off on pain put them in the same scenario without their consent and you have severe trauma
NONE it is absolutely a mental disorder i mean what else could it be surely it s not a biological disorder it s probably closely related to that disorder where people feel like a part of their body is foreign like a leg or something and they want it removed even though it s perfectly healthy there s something in their brain that cause a disconnection from the reality of their body when it come to amputating healthy limb no doctor with any sense of morality would dream of it i do nt see this any different though i do think the best choice is probably to let them have a gender reassignment surgery seeing a suicide rate are astronomically high for transgender people i do nt know i m conflicted i do think that it is a mental disorder however and research should be done to potentially find drug that can treat it
AH or integer or complex number or any situation where a reasonable person would use and there are comparatively few situation where doe nt equal four and all of them are not the default so you d be in the minority and i expect you re being pedantic and disingenuous to make a point but you are nt doing a good job
NONE yes but is nt the idea that you could be terrorized by police and all that over a joke absurd you already could in some case such a joking about a bomb on an airplane or a school shooting but your idea would be so much more intrusive because it would be in all aspect of normal life not just restricted to certain place
AH so now you say you re speculating on the thought process of the manager which is nt what you said before you should say what you mean instead of thing that are demonstrably false who s downvoting you i would nt know maybe you should have admitted you re just splitting hair instead of being a crybaby about it
NONE but how could you know that you would nt maybe you do nt even think you are the one but one of the death that will cause people to start reevaluating their position would nt living be a safer choise safer choice than death yes i think that is technically correct

AH yeah okay so it s clear that you are just childish i m not married and do nt have a kid i wa just providing a hypothetical it s clear that you are only okay with this scenario if the kid take the man s name again what is so confusing about deciding to give a kid the woman s last name and it s really amusing how you resort to name calling asshole gay you seem to be overreacting to the pettiest of nothingness i imagine you a an angry year old boy who ha no idea about the real world tell me how accurate i am
NONE so that s why i do nt date black girl that s a present tense statement it s a statement based on the person s experience up until that point in time and therefore the current mindset of the person it might be foolish to say so that s why i do nt date black girl and never will because there s no way i d ever find one attractive because that s an awfully big assumption but even then even then the person is still making a judgment call about who they find physically attractive what if a gay man said that he d never date a woman would you find this equally offensive
AH the case law is on my side cite case law saying i am wrong and i will consider it otherwise gtfo with this speculative argument

NONE they ve rejected my precious delta could you try again with a sentence or two about what i said that you found convincing i really need this delta man i have a family
AH do you have anything better to do with your time than to try to put me down i felt like i made this with pretty good intention you seem so angry at men you are so radical it distasteful it ok that you disagree with someone but it seems like you would like to see me in jail for my thinking that is why a lot of people are against sjws please cool off and do nt come back to this sub your lunch break is too long all the comment from you are extremely negative and you come across a bullying at this point i wa never hostile to you i just wanted to see some good argument and here you are just being rude a fuck go away
NONE the thing is you do nt always know when you are in danger and it make you cautious i ve turned down guy and had it turn out fine i ve turn down other guy and had them follow my down a train platform calling me an ungrateful cunt and sometimes it really is your friend turning against you or hurting you most sexual assault are done by people we know and even then it can be something physically harmless and emotionally hurtful in short it s a better to be safe than sorry and it s hard to know what the safe decision will be
AH nice ad hominem there really quality response i m not even sure that you disagree with my position so it s interesting that you felt the need to even respond to me in the first place you have offered nothing to the discussion at hand when i asked you to support the claim that men and woman are generally equal part masculine and feminine you responded by saying that men and woman lean slightly on the masculine feminine side respectively you have said men and woman are not fully masculine or feminine great that s exactly what i said to begin with but you did nt bother reading or you lack the reading comprehension skill to understand simple sentence even so your claim is purely anecdotal and factually unprovable the number of men who are are feminine are hardly statistically insignificant again you are claiming to know something which you can not possibly know nor can you go about proving it men who are excessively feminine are irrelevant a far a a useful heuristic go they are not the norm and neither are the woman who would find themselves attracted to an effeminate man these two group are completely statistically insignificant also men and woman do nt have masculine and feminine trait in the sense that any one trait is either masculine or feminine each trait exists on a spectrum wherein one can be more or le to either side the aggregate sum of each of these trait will indicate that men are masculine and woman are feminine with a high degree of frequency regardless this whole exchange is far far off topic so good job on wasting my time with your desire to be contrary with needle semantics compelling discussion truly novel
NONE a in an artificial one they put on to show that they re actually gay i would nt call it artificial it s real and you can hear it when you talk with many gay men i think it s socially learned just like all language and accent are gender role are basically stereotype right somewhat though they do have an obvious basis in biology let s not forget that now your gender identity ha nothing to with those correct they are strongly correlated but not always linked the point is that we should allow for exception then the way you present yourself is based on your sexuality which again is nt related to your gender did i get that right it doe nt have to be based on sexuality i simply selected sexuality a the most valid reason in for presenting a a particular gender since you seem to suggest there is no use or purpose in for it some people appear a woman because they re biologically woman and it s easy some people appear a woman for the purpose of easily finding a male mate some people appear a woman because they identify a woman and want others to treat them the way they are most comfortable some people appear a woman because they have interest in stereotypical woman s hobby and activity and want to minimize negative social response so there are lot of reason why people present a certain gender and for different people the reasoning is different but all of these reason are real and valid and serve a purpose these purpose make sense and help people and society therefore they should still continue to exist
AH your only rebuttal to the above user wa you re a conformist oh really http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentshjvcmvfatfeminismisawarpeddenialofmedicalcqlatxe this might be a reasonable criticism of some fat people you see in the hospital but your stereotype do nt apply to everyone you ll have to figure out which of them are a burden in order to thrust that criticism at them and it s wrong to discriminate against an entire group of people for a problem that they re not themselves contributing to when you see an overweight person you do nt know whether he or she is a burden deliberately offending them is nt justifiable only deciding to try and attack my character projection http enwikipediaorgwikipsychologicalprojection you have nothing else to offer and plenty of it i m done wasting my time with you
NONE do they have some kind of legitimate point that i am not seeing no you are nt missing anything rworldnews ha been like this for a while the comment are often toxic and the level of discussion is pretty superficial i unsubsubscribed some time ago but i ll head over there sometimes to lurk if you re looking for news you d do better here http newsgooglecomnewssection topicw nedus or here http wwwreuterscomnewsworld if you re looking for a place to discus that news there are better sub for that than rworldnews though nothing with the same number of subscriber edit i just wanted to add that i m not sure if it s fair to call it a haven for bigot since i do nt know whether the mod of that subreddit approve of the bigotry you re talking about with that many subscriber and a relatively tiny mod team they re probably struggling to keep up with all the mod action required a it is

AH lol what a laughable dipshit
NONE that is horrible and ridiculous
AH i m talking to you still because the dissonance you re feeling everytime you refuse to acknowledge your hypocrisy might dissuade you from being a hypocrite in the future i m not feeling any dissonance at all i m feeling like everything i said initially ha been validated to a pretty comedic degree and with your unexamined anger motivating this continued bratty harassment it just keep proving my point more and more you chose to end the discussion and reject literally anything i post so go away please
NONE i do nt think you are aware of the full situation pretty much everything you say is either misinformed or false from the reason to the outcome of this situation towards greece itself and europe however the explanation is multilayered and rather longwinded and somebody did the work already so i think it would be dishonest to just copypaste what he wrote and present it a my own so i ll give a link and hope you ll read it http wwwredditcomrworldnewscommentsbbtgreekbailoutextensionrefusedcskzx
AH that s an absolutely unacceptable moral judgement on other human being i specifically went out of my way to say it not a moral judgement so fuck you the condition doe not deserve to be celebrated we do nt celebrate birth defect i said nothing at all about the people
NONE i guess the point is what s the harm in waiting i understand the visceral reaction but that s why we have a legal system to make sure people do nt just viscerally react to thing it seems better to treat them according to the rule of war than react without thinking
AH alright man you re a badass i m still not scared of you i m already missing teeth and my joint are already fucked up i know you re a badass in training but you re obviously a dumbass to get involved with random dude on the street do you have a wife or kid how would they feel about your action are you assuming you walk away scratch le living the rest of your life missing an eye or a piece of you re face would you feel it wa all worth it make no mistake i am no pussy and would have no problem shooting or stabbing your big dumb as or maybe you re such a supreme badass that you walk away unscathed well to do that you would have had to of killed me are you willing to kill a man over your weight you realize that while i m no body to you i m family to others my family is what we will call affiliated there s a chance that they wo nt be happy that you killed me in the end there s no winning keep you re bad as ness in the ring do nt put your life at risk over your ego

AH i do nt care if you ve been there oh we re moving goalpost first my flaw is that i do nt know what you re experiencing then i tell you that i do now my flaw is something else you ve been cheated on so in your mind there ca nt be people who go through life happy with one partner no i m sure they exist however i m quite firmly convinced that such people do not need to impose a strict monogamous expectation on each other they just do it again i do not oppose monogamous practice monogamous practice work great for me most of the time what i oppose is shoehorning your partner not allowing them to be who they are if your partner is perfectly fine being monogamous that s great just do nt expect it i wonder if it s possible that you re actually aware of how arrogant and bullheaded you are oh believe me i know very well how i am perceived the thing is i no longer care my inner response to all you jealous asshole is fuck you you jealous assholes anyone who s selfworth and personal sense of security depends entirely on the genitals of their partner doe not deserve my respect

AH get a real job and stop expecting handout
NONE upvote for making me really want a cookie
AH a survey i have nt found so if you consider that the only valid form of evidence then you can smugly conclude i m full of bullshit well yes you are full of shit for making an appeal to authority about the belief of the psychology community when you had no basis for the claim this summary from princeton state that an enormous body of literature confirms the existence of implicit bias this is a very vague statement about people in general having bias in general and doe nt at all support your claim about a pervasive bias against woman besides this is nt an academic paper or research of any sort here is an example of harvard s work on implicit bias this doe nt support your claim either here is a publication from the american psychological association this is nt research either and doe nt support your claim in the first place ok i m done fishing through all of this random crap for something that support your original claim you claimed that the notion of a pervasive bias against woman wa quite well accepted by the psychology community aside from that statement using weaselwords and not making any sense on it s own you have so far shown nothing to support such a claim it seems to me like you took all the anecdote you have heard and made a cursory read of some very small experiment and then decided that the world at large must reflect your own impression
NONE i feel that that is the fault of your local paper and not the writer themselves it is indeed sensationalized but it s meant to be an opinion piece the fact that your paper published the article mean that they did nt know it wa a blog and published it or they knew it wa a blog but the people behind the paper hold those same view i feel that either way that is the fault of those in charge of your local newspaper for including such a misleading story that wa taken out of it original context for that we put le blame on the medium and news in general and more blame onto those who circulate it the original article wa nt intended to share groundbreaking new finding it wa meant to be a blogger sharing his view on an observed trend he found whether all of the fact were there or not the fact that it wa taken out of context by your local paper show the true problem with the medium today i m not saying your local paper is pushing any sort of agenda but the fact that they posted this article a a nonopinion piece show that they hold these view to be the truth this is a fault of your newspaper and not so much the fault of shitty journalism per say the original article itself trying to get back on track to your original cmv is nt atrocious journalism because it wa never meant to be serious journalism it wa posted on a blog to be discussed and picked at the fact that your local paper published it doe nt necessarily change that fact
AH wewlad any other unfounded assumption you want to get off your chest
NONE because fuck your imaginary line that people should nt be able to cross
AH you doing that is exactly what started this argument i am not misrepresenting anything i quote because it s wrong for a small group of people to hinder access to idea and information that they disagree with this is a personal value judgement that you are presenting a a matter of objective fact something which is technically referred to a being a condescending and selfimportant jerk so get off your high horse and stop acting like everyone else should play by your moral rule
NONE the dissonance is because you know it s an assumption based on an emotional response a opposed to a concrete deduction based on fact or at least a large data set you re right to be pissed and it make sense to connect your anger with a group culturally different than you what would nt make sense is deducing that people of this culture are by nature rude and inconsiderate in any circumstance and from what i gather you are nt doing that
AH no but that wa never the discussion the discussion wa about giving the info to russia changing the discussion to keep an argument going is a well known troll tactic
NONE i know what the argument is but even if the woman s right is overruled in the end it s still the other part of the debate it s a woman s right issue even if they lose
AH windowless room is not windowless school at least now i know you went to public school because your reading comprehension is so lacking
NONE there is no need to change your mind on this op i am in a university and people who want space space and see themselves a victim are loser
AH to be totally clear if you just wanted to post the context that bad you d probably have posted the link alone instead you took stats that are not always the best indication of what those study actually found and posted them so you re saying these study found these number but they do nt actually mean what they say yet you ve provided no evidence for this i could say the same for you no you could nt i provided the data and how it wa collected i do nt have to do anymore than that it s your job to show how i m wrong woah there do nt forget the breakdown here i would strongly hesitate to lump partially justified with totally justified break it down all you want partially justified is still fucking justified no but given that these are entirely different argument i see no reason to bring it up is it bringing in people into our country our home that have a chance of feeling wa justified is scary a fuck and lefty like yourself who want nothing else than to prove your virtue is worth signaling are putting u all at risk for a group that pride itself on tolerance you guy sure do suck islam dick a lot also out of curiosity where d you find the list to repost the internet
NONE people would contribute to open source only if their livelihood is secured okay but that doe nt address my point which is that these editor are not receiving monetary compensation so why do they do it what quick incentive is there for editor on wikipedia i grew up in a developing country where there is no social security or enough job no offense but this doe nt really mean anything developing country can have vastly different quality of life what is the specific country your post history suggests india but if like to hear it from you it might be different when you live in a developed nation and all the hue and cry about capitalism might sound valid i m not sure what you mean here again have you ever worked a job where you were compensated in a nonpecuniary way wa it because of militaristic communism i do nt know so did you change your view your op make it sound like you re certain that people only do thing if they get a quick incentive but now you re saying you do nt know if that s true the scientist exodus from ussr doe nt really support the socialism cause when wa that
AH what the expansion of the universe determines the distribution of matter and antimatter but that s the most it ha to do with where life is and is nt uh huh you re saying life is only on earth nice catch there or are you unfamiliar with darwin s evolution the rest of your comment is either mindless drivelnitpicking to the nth degree or support what i wrote concisely in the first place you fail to see that your comment wa not needed in that sense
NONE i think that the problem lie in the question itself it doe nt express clearly what the person is actually asking a better form of the question should be along the line of what s your place of heritage that way the question doe nt sound like it s characterizing the person being asked a nonamerican nongerman etc where are you from is more what country are you from because it s not this one to a lot of minority who already feel out of place in their current country
AH journalist here thought i d found a scoop fuck you op
NONE doe that mean i can say the nword edit geez it s a joke
AH you re not a creator of anything you re a redditor the creator are the people that allow you to be one society doe nt have to adapt to people like you because people like you are weak most people want to play by the rule so your effect on what happens to everybody else is insignificant you re just a crook desperately trying to justify his lack of moral
NONE i think interviewing people on the street segment are dumb a shit a a rule if you ask enough people you can basically make whatever segment you want and of people are going to not know something that would make them look stupid on a talk show and generally it only purpose is to pander to a common audience who get to briefly feel like they re smart it s terrible television

NONE i have always thought that the medical community should work on the ability to transplant an embryofetus
AH do you make a habit out of making an as of yourself or is that merely a disguise if a venue make it money off of nightly rambunctiousness and then with a change of management order key nightly patron off that place will close down in a matter of month and the owner after month of loss will wonder why the success ha come to a trickle and the manager will come up with all manner of excuse truthfully stating out of ignorance that they have nt a clue a to why club membership ha fallen and chance are a with most business they ll never know but they will see with envious eye a the new club in town is bustling with business it is after all now the coolest thing in town btw i wa intrigued by fph for a while and then unsubscribed too much negativity yet who am i to decided what other fellow redditors should put before their eye who are any of you any of u
NONE first of all i think you re talking federal politician only which is much harder to seem honest and open because of the nature of the job they re trying to play nice with everyone so they do nt make too many enemy that will block their bill and have friend to help pas them and also satisfy all of their constituent it can be very hard to please everyone at once like this without seeming watered down right now i d say bernie sander is my best pick for a fairly honest good hearted fed what your post precludes however are small local politician people running for city council county office or even small town and neighbourhood council these people have much stronger tie to their community and know the need of their people much better and so can be much more personable my best example of one of these politician from the top of my head would be harvey milk may he rest in peace
AH scared because you should be we are gon na make america and europe white again

AH fuck you ad fuck islam muhammad can suck my ball it a violent religion that put down woman
NONE if your religion ca nt stand up to joke made against it it s not a strong enough belief
AH if you believe leftist are increasing in number i never said any such thing it would make sense that the counteropinion is also increasing even if i had said that this would nt necessarily follow social norm are changing that doe nt mean leftist are increasing in number whatever the fuck that could mean it does mean that the dad in kansa who is staunchly prolife only a little weirded out by gay is distrustful of mexican a a group but chummy with them a individual is more likely to encourage his daughter to establish herself in a career before getting married and more likely to teach his son to treat woman with respect not because they are woman but because they are people no increase in leftist just a shifting of the base line trpmra is a direct opposer of feminism which is having it s pretty hardcore view taught in university classroom that sound scary tell me more trp is a symptom of the constant disenfranchisement from people like feminist and blm activist you keep fighting that fight brother i ll keep ignoring you
NONE i have trouble accepting that they are harmed because they are denied their full potential why because you do nt like the conclusion it would certainly be harmful to lock a thirteen year old in a basement why would the fact that the child wa born in a basement and psychologically conditioned to think that a basement wa all there is make it any le tragic from an objective perspective that there is a being whose interest in personal autonomy are nt being considered if the only thing that is problematic is that someone knows they are being denied basic right then it s perfectly acceptable to just go around killing people in a persistent vegetative state assuming you lie to their relative and say their life support failed in a freak accident they were nt going to live forever and by killing them you did something useful by saving the resource their family would have used on extended life support i d argue that many people think murder and deception are immoral and while that doe nt necessarily prove my point it doe indicate that the view you re proposing is nt quite a common sense a you believe
AH haha look kiddo you can try to get a rise out of me all you want but it s not gon na work keep fishin
NONE that feel when you do nt believe in a god and you see all these wall of text and you re just like k den
AH you re a dumbass if you think all muslim are extremist you stupid bigoted fuck
NONE youre not wrong dont listen to these people trying to argue for the sake of arguing
AH so you ve just given up on even trying to defend your original argument against you yes i have a rule if i repeat myself three time and the person i m talking to is too thick understand what i m saying i give up is it any coincidence that this change in position only came after i pointed out to you that jail is for people who have already committed a crime and not just people who are capable of doing so at some point my god do you huff paint it is nt a change in position it s a different way of approaching the argument is baiting people to commit a crime wrong it fall perfectly in line with my original point that people who steal bait car are shitty people to begin with ie they are nt some poor upstanding chap who wa just could nt resist the temptation therefore you re wrong to feel sorry for them and baiting people is nt wrong
NONE not necessarily with the act in general but your cmv seemed to also indicate instance where there were people who did nt want to partake when i m hanging out with people they generally do nt attempt to get smashed because they know my feeling but sometimes it happens other time it seems like people do nt care because they ve never been in my position before they do nt take the time to understand why it would suck to be the sober one because they ve never been in that position and view smoking a inconsequential i view it a lot like drinking if you want to get blasted on your own or with someone that s fine and i do nt care when there s someone who ca nt get drunk it s a different ball game because people s interest do change slightly and that can be the difference between being board and having a good time
AH let me start off a you can quote me rude comment renovedto appease mods with that being said let me explain why you still have no intention of properly participating in a cmv being proven in your other cmv http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsdfmcmvthefirefightersinnycmadegigantic i wish you or the mod kept your ignorant and crass view up reason i say crass is that every time a person asked for a source you claim heavily researched data but you provide no source ok now to this so called cmv a unevadacynic brings up asbestos that is a critical point any amount is dangerous large or small it is dangerous it need to be properly removed to prevent further damage to others in the near future way to go for put others at further risk for your personal gain you must have some used zyklonb to sell also like i said in my other post to you prior if i m going to be banned so be it
NONE what is the purpose of a doctor s visit you the patient go to the doctor for their advice generally you are not an expert on health and anything they can tell you is appreciated you the patient go to the doctor to ask a specific set of question you are not interested in anything above and beyond the answer to question x y z while i would hope that most people would operate under assumption there are some people there are people that wo nt let a doctor examine them beyond their immediate concern i came here for a broken arm no i will not take off my pant if a patient present with a problem that they do nt perceive a being related to their weight even if it is and they are a patient they can see the doctor a going beyond what they ought to be doing a a more concrete example a patient going in for a vaccination may view any comment about their weight a unwarranted just give me the shot anything else will be viewed with hostility and anger
AH you re a fucking asshole you worthless piece of shit who doe nt deserve to live you may be compelled to hit the report button which is fine but you would in effect invalidate your argument none of those word are anything bad it s text on a screen but it s employment is how these word carry weight we value respect these word are disrespectful if you call someone retarded it may carry no offensive weight according to you but if the word above do it is inconsistent to hold your position i will admit i ve seen those who find retarded offensive be inconsistent you moron your use of retarded is offensive moron wa a word used to describe retarded people
NONE i doubt there are any good argument that swearing is actually morally wrong however word have connotation and what make swear word swear word is that they have the connotation of being vulgar when people swear they are showing that they do nt care about being seen a professional or dignified this is probably what your coworker meant when he said people educated like you notice that if i say i do nt care it come across very differently than if i say i do nt give a fuck now this doe nt mean that it s wrong to swear but you should certainly keep in mind how you come across to people when you speak including when you re shouting at your computer within earshot of others
AH how s this for a threshold grow the fuck up and present him with specific incident that he can respond to by investigating the incident finding the fact and punishing the guilty instead they charged institutional racism which is a bullshit move because he now ha to prove his innocence which is simply impossible
NONE later he said when he came under fire for his blatantly racist assumption the idea that a man of mexican heritage would not be able to be impartial to him indicates racism he is free to question whether or not he is receiving a fair trial but when he insinuates someone is unfit for the job because of their race it is clear racism
AH i hope you re a troll and if not i hope you are someday able to get over whatever is troubling you so much
NONE i m not op i just wanted to remind you to give one also if you do nt give any explanation they wo nt allow it

NONE i guess definition are created to be useful in conversation if we ca nt agree on the definition than the conversation is pointless so yeah there is no such thing a an objective strawman so what still doe nt matter though if you ca nt provide an objective moral axiom than objective morality doe not exist that s all i have to say on the matter my patience ha expired the fact that other thing are subjective are independent to this
AH do nt go blowing anything up now ya hear
NONE go apeshit buddy just do nt do drug
AH you re evading the question i m giving an accurate answer regarding my belief if that doe nt satisfy your desire to cast everything in a false dichotomy it is nt my problem if you re so much better and we all just have no clue then why do nt you teach u and try to show u how to advocate for men s issue and get something done gladly practice the following chose your framing and rhetoric appropriately so a to be receptive to your audience do more than complain that someone else ha not yet done something for you work to solve your issue directly avoid meaningless and useless exercise in oppresionlympics i ca nt guarantee success but you ll have accomplished more than you have so far go forth pupil and do good work unto the world well how about the problem of the empathy gap sound good what have you done except whine about it the fact that men s issue ca nt gain traction in the general public that s rough what step have you taken to fix that you know the very thing i m trying to get you to acknowledge even exists at all i love a direct qoute of me saying it doe nt exist i take that back i did nt mean it let s assume that i m willing to concede that there are certain issue that men face that are not currently at the forefront of the public mind this is a safe assumption a i have said exactly that thing in at least a few place in this thread how have you worked to change that so how about not evading the question anymore and we can actually move on for a change i have nt evaded a single question nor do any of your accusation or assumption about me and my thought and feeling have any merit at all i m perfectly willing to have a conversation with you should you decide to drop the accusatory and hostile tone you ve had from the beginning of this thread whatcha got mother fucker what you wan na rap about
NONE this entire thing is ridiculous you want people to convince you that you were nt being heartless and yet you say you ca nt argue emotional view you say that you do nt want to get into the specific of your relationship here and would rather focus on the general topic of dumping someone who is otherwise perfect over debt when the entire focus is on you specifically and in the topic you specifically ask if you re a terrible person what exactly are you seeking in coming here absolution someone to make you feel better about yourself because of something that you did that everyone in your life ha said is heartless cause i really do nt think you re going to find it here not factoring in emotion and making purely pragmatic choice is basically the definition of heartless the real question that matter here is where you place your value and if those value align with others or the societal norm and if they do nt how much you care about that you made the pragmatic and heartless because again definition decision is that wrong that s ultimately a question only time and you are going to be able to answer for yourself i feel like maybe you have nt had enough bad dating experience to know how valuable what you had really wa but that s something you ll find out or not maybe you ll get lucky or maybe you have the experience and you do realize it and ultimately it doe nt matter to you the increased security and comfort outweighs the love that you had assuming it wa love and not puppy love and how you react to that what you think about it and what come of it will determine your future but only you can decide that deciding to come in here because you feel bad about being told that you did something heartless when you did indeed do something heartless is foolish the only thing that matter is what that s worth to you
AH your response is exactly the problem and exactly why you are culpable for these death if liberal are nt proposing good solution propose something more effective
NONE believe strongly that the principle of free speech are much more important than a handful of subreddits no you dont because your still here supporting reddit
AH you in absolutely no way are justified in assaulting a person for any reason but selfdefense i just think that s idiotic

AH you ca nt possibly be this daft right i hope you re just being a pedantry troll co otherwise i do nt even know okay look all that aside several point smart car did not ubiquitously mean automated vehicle at the time the company wa formed it wa used in some area of transportation research but hardly a it is today hoverboard ha been an understood and accepted term for board that hover since the see back to the future the company smart is not smartcar technology that may be misleading if the company hoverboard technology wa just hover technology that made single wheel selfbalancing board that s not misleading nothing at all about hoverboard tehcnology s board hovers it doe nt linger it is a transportation device it doe nt hover it s on the ground and on a wheel it doe nt site between two decision because i do nt think any sort of skateboard doe smart on the other hand could be smart by a number of definition sans the automation usage for example http wwwecosmartcom an ecofriendly pesticide smart in this usage fit the vehicle very much so that are made by smart ca nt really find a similar associated usage with hoverboard
NONE personally i m with you i think it s fine but that s irrelevant what matter is that in many state it s against the law to use them that way however it look like you re allowed to use hazard light in georgia according to this blog from an insurance company http blogesurancecomwarningyoumaybeusingyourhazardlightsincorrectly uasibdvy and this list from aaa http drivinglawsaaacomlawshazardlightuse some state like florida seem to disallow hazard light while a car is in motion for any reason some state like virginia allow it only in certain circumstance rain doe nt count unless you re going under mph a well finally remember just because you can find some people mad about it on the internet doe nt mean it s a common viewpoint people vent their bizarre frustration about trivial shit like this all the time some people also seem to have a kneejerk reaction to other people breaking rule even when their rule are nt actually the law or do nt make any sense hope i changed your view about something in there even though it turn out you were nt wrong at least in the state you were in
AH disclaimer i m an american middle class white girl lol who woulda guess or you are a troll when your ancestor for several century degrade other race tell them how inferior they are and mock them such movement a black pride or native american pride are necessary and important
NONE people have assumed that about me a someone from sc but in my experience working in a large tourist city they quickly see that i am none of those thing and we all get along just fine and if not oh well the stereotype is not a harmful a the effect of racism and bigotry no
AH people who make content for the internet and also need to feed their family should figure out how to have a second job on the side so stupid spoiled douchebags can enjoy the content they make while not having any form of advertisement anywhere on the website right
NONE they could but then it would get cropped out of the picture the goal is for them to be a little bit obvious they are just there to indicate that a professonal work is professional they are also there to stop people from passing on professional work a their own
AH you re an idiot if you do nt think that simple collection target shooting hunting or skeet are not reason for gun ownership good thing that the government think i can i think i ll celebrate and go buy another gun something with all those cosmetic feature that drive people like you crazy that will be a nice late christmas present for myself
NONE yes my comment wa basically pointing out you did nt say good christian but look at all the other rule i doubt many people truly believe they are good christian you are picking one controversial rule in a book filled with them homosexual are no different for example going of your statement a person that ha tattoo must also say that he is not a good christian
AH great you ve cleverly shown that the statement nobody would kill is wrong by pointing out that murderer exist what a great work of logic it wa certainly worth investing time into reply to every one of your comment are nt you proud of yourself i hope you appreciate the sarcasm seriously i ca nt conceive how you thought this argument would produce anything but contempt from me did you really think this would be acceptable i understand we re both tired of this but still either put some effort or do nt reply at all i do nt really want to participate in a discussion with you any more i hope you do grasp why i m angry with you
NONE i think it s fine if you do nt vote and i agree with all of the argument you make however i still think it s a good idea to vote if the fact that you do nt vote ever come up in a conversation people want you to explain why you do nt vote in addition many people are likely to either get angry at you or think le of you once they hear you do nt vote you can take some response from this thread a evidence of that in many place it take minute to an hour to vote and i think spending that time is certainly worth it given the time you ll waste explaining yourself and the anger you ll get pointing your way if you do nt
AH gift faggot case closed is it prounounced fucking jift fuck you
NONE fuck you yanktards christopher columbus wa a badass
AH yeah but i scrub account every couple month so why bother well minus none of it being real yeah i guess so also comey got up and perjured himself openly before the congress so now his head should roll a we know the fbi is corrupt and lie even to the congress aye fat and flabby and still kicking your as and leaving you snarling and grasping at straw
NONE i ca nt believe this get people panty in a bunch while half the shit you read on here about people suffering or dying on film is a joke and entertainment i mean it is but then so are you and so is this reddit soap opera and everything else that will be forgotten promptly after the next dank repost we really are the worst generation who is victoria anyway some fucking lady is all
AH not really but i would nt expect you to understand nuance since you sound like a high school dropout with a dead end career
NONE yes i am i do feel that this is a more global problem right now but i can only speak specifically to american culture
AH no silly the issue of there being a gray area of the definition of being too drunk to consent i m a lawyer do nt send me any more of this retarded bullshit
NONE after reading some of this thread i feel like i should basically just forget about sex romance friendship just being accepted in any way a a person by the majority of other people
AH if you tried be be a little le antagonistic people might listen to your argument instesd of writing them and you off good luck and i hope you have a good new year
NONE lot of people myself included agreeing with op commenting here so i remember to come back and check for someone who ha good counterpoint because i think that ll be tough
AH this comment is still idiotic
NONE this comment is preposterously misinformed
AH if you re saying the previous legislation necessitating the civil right act wa the legislation that originally instituted slavery well yes the fix for a bad law is often a better law that doe nt mean government intervention is inherently broken government create problem they do nt solve them and actually modern day racism still explains quite a bit i detailed out multiple example of why it is nt and you come back here and say it is all of those problem were in line with the population prior to desegregation today they are skyrocketing problem if you are going to argue that they are nt problem you need to provide some evidence to them regarding paying back loan you have a chicken and an egg problem past racism creates condition that make you le likely to pay the loan back so you are telling me that year old cant get loan that that is prohibiting the year old today from getting loan not buying it past racism ha nothing to do with the credit of the younger generation if you ve never been in poverty fuck right off and your assumption been there done that and pulled myself out of it you clearly do nt want to have a discussion based in fact because you are unwilling to respond to the very specific and explicit argument i ve made
NONE i m a libertarian myself so i get where you are coming from in an ideal world the government should have a much smaller role in our life the problem that i always face is that we do nt live in an ideal world to pull many of our basic social safety net program would condemn million of american to deeper poverty than we have now people would be starving or dying on the street and that just is nt the world i want to live in i would love it if individual would handle that burden without the government but until they do we need something to prevent a much worse scenario from occurring when it come to pp i m going to be paying for those child either way in many case if that child is brought to term then i m on the hook for wic welfare etc to help raise that child from a purely fiscal perspective it s a better value to pay for an unwanted child to not be born than to pay for all the other program they ll need if they are it s a shitty choice but life is full of shitty choice and this seems to be the least shitty of them a an aside i hate the deep in debt argument in situation like these government debt doe nt work like private debt and we should nt equate the two so long a we can meet our interest payment and do nt default we never have and have many solution if we get close then it s not a big concern
AH ya my minority friend are awesome so they do nt get teased by anyone but their friend saw my gay friend the other week and first thing i asked him wa how many dick he had sucked since i saw him last sometimes i offer him a pillow to sit on or to bite keep your psycho sjw bullshit away from me
NONE i kinda agree with op when i wa i called thing gay called people faggot etc once i went to h and actually met gay guy i realized i wa a horrible dick and stopped if i never met one of my best gay friend would i have been a bigot a an adult i hope not but meeting him certainly fixed my attitude faster
AH physical harm is considered worse than emotional or financial harm by whom ask most guy who are stuck with year of unwanted child support payment if they d take a weeklong bout of kidney stone if it meant they could avoid the year of child support payment and you d get a large percentage likely a vast majority taking that trade i wonder why you are nt surprised it wa simply a throwaway troll statement that you gobbled up so you think husband should just magically know when their wife are trying to poison them no we re back to the lying again if a man chooses to have sex with a woman he know is trying to vaginally poison him that s on him
NONE funeral and obituary are not for the dead they re for the living asshole or not there are still people grieving this loss and they only stand to suffer from an honest obituary he may not deserve positive mention after his death but his parent do nt need a reminder that their son wa a cunt what is to be gained from telling the world about his assholeishness will it make him le of an asshole will it lessen the suffering of those feeling his absence if the only reason you can think of is it would make me feel better do nt do it bite the bullet say a few nice word and make someone else s life slightly better when they need it most otherwise you re just personally picking up his asshole mantle
AH you poor kid ca nt even afford a second reddit account it s amazing that two people so concerned that they do nt get paid enough have found each other i hope you live a long contented life with your imaginary so
NONE i think this first depends on their age if they are too young they will have no idea what they are getting if it is a teenager or something then sure i can see that kid a is happier in the short run but kid b is happier in the long run
AH oh god you re one of them please reconsider your life choice
NONE no bro it human nature life is short do whatever you want
AH you re victim blaming the victim for what she did or did nt do during an attack that you have no idea what it wa like you re a mansplaining victim blamer by your very own word and somehow think you re relevant to what happened and you re just part of the mob postcleanup
NONE i d still view it a an invasion of privacy if someone stole a diary and then gave it to you it s no le invasive to knowingly read it a it would be if you stole it yourself just because you re not a thief doe nt make the subsequent action any le wrong
AH since you deleted your other comment your one source ha been known a a terrible argument for so long you have no right to call other people s argument unsourced i bet you do nt even realize how long that article ha been out nor how long it s been discredited meanwhile this fuckin guy right here got his degree in econ and you think you know more about the subject than i do that s what make this so painfully obvious that it s a waste of my time you re not here to learn you re here to argue i bet if a physicist chimed in right now and said i wa right about the unpredictability of wind speed you would continue to argue just because you re that stubborn it s pointless and a waste of my time like how many time do i have to say the negative affect on employment extend beyond the rate for you to realize what that mean because you keep repeating the same old argument referring to the rate you have nt got a clue i feel bad for you and your lack of selfawareness
NONE imagine you re a kid and you re thinking about doing some shitty thing your parent said that if you re good they ll give you present but they re not here right now so they ll never know you were bad so you can just do the bad thing and you ll still get present basically santa and arguably god too is a proxy for conscience it help a kid to do the right thing if they have some external figure giving them guidance even if that external figure is imaginary i think there s also a critical thinking aspect to it at some point they ll figure out that santa is nt real and that everything that contributed to their idea of santa is a massive social contrivance they ll learn that not everything that adult tell them is absolutely true and that they need to critically examine new idea ironically i think a lot of atheistagnostic folk who grew up in religious household first start to question the idea of god when they find out that they ve been lied to about santa so perhaps it s actually a pretty constructive deception when you think about it in that way
AH not to be mean but the thing is to a hardcore trumper you are the delusional one to anyone with the faintest inkling of the fact uthereasonableman is delusional
NONE would you give a few inch to those that claim the earth is flat vaccine are bad or climate change is nt real this is my new argument for no label nice one
AH that s a nonanswer and come across a trolling
NONE this is the best point that s been made so far
AH there are innate difference in personality related to sex the evidence on that is very clear you call them stereotype but it s actually the exact opposite people have different personality woman are generally higher in neuroticism and openness that s not to say that all woman are but on average most are this is a stereotype you just contradicted yourself are you talking to adult or other weak over emotional sjw conservative man boy that agree with you regardless of his source this issue ha been debated and researched for well over year and is nt going to be resolved in a forum or in a condescending page memo this disruptive approach to any issue inside an organization is the real issue which is why i shared the medium response to begin with the workplace is not your own personal political soapbox
NONE you have the sound of someone too young to have seen how equality group change opinion over time you seem to young to have seen the gradual change of public opinion when it come to race or gender or orientation the dirty little secret to the evolution of right being extended is that it s never done in one generation young people are convinced first while there are people who are so set in their way that they can not be convinced they eventually die you think that gay marriage is a hot topic it s not that battle ha already been won especially with people under and there ha been a lot of movement in the generation between in year most people under are going to see nothing wrong with gay marriage it s precisely because of equality group that these topic get on the table in the first place
AH i ve heard this same sentiment so many time i just assume it is a troll everything you wrote is a total failure of reason it not even an inevitable logical leap one ha to get beyond a typical existential crisis it is a total failure to grasp the fundamental nature of the world around you and your self fine the universe will end before that our galaxy will wink out of existence before that our sun will die and our solar system disappear before that our planet will be rendered lifeless before that our specie will likely die off or evolve so much a to be unrecognizable well before all off that you will die you re focused on an end that is many order of magnitude beyond what you need to consider that show a complete lack of perspective you say life ha no meaning i say so what in what way would you expect life to have meaning before you can claim life ha no meaning you should have a concept of what circumstance would give life meaning which you obviously lack you re saying your life is lacking something you have nt defined that is a complete and utter failure of reason
NONE i m going to challenge the notion that this is actually a view rather than just a stated scientific fact in statistic the more barrier to entry something ha the smaller the probability of it occurrence selfinduced extinction can happen any number of way and only ha to happen time ever because we will be extinct thereafter just off the top of my head we can nuke each other to death we irrevocably pollute the planet and die we have a scientific accident that cause global catastrophe and cause u to go extinct the list go on but my point is is that there are numerous way we can cause ourselves a selfinduced extinction world peace can only happen exactly one way we come together in peace how that happens doe nt matter because world peace is or is not there is no middle ground in addition every day after the first day of world peace must continue to have world peace thereafter meaning that the barrier of entry sky rocket because it ha to happen for literally all of time after it s inception so your view is nt really a view stated a is you are stating a simple statistical fact
AH are you claiming that a forprofit business can not by definition be ethical because profit is no healthcare and car are not the same product profit do nt get in the way of anyone s reasonable well being in the latter it could certainly be debated but healthcare is very obviously something that everyone needs at some point so profiteering in regard to it creates problem i think your equation of profit with greed and evil is misguided and juvenile i think your reading comprehension level is juvenile stop putting word in my mouth i said none of that
NONE i do nt think there is any evidence that nicotine itself is bad for you it s smoking that is bad for you but in any case a someone else pointed out it s not clear that it is rational to value health over other thing in life that make you happy is person a stupid for choosing to live a shorter but happier life than person b i think an argument can certainly be made that you are the one making a logical mistake by irrationally putting too much emphasis on longevity it s really not obvious that length of life is the endallbeall of what should guide someone s decision making
AH what on earth do frozen account prove i d be pretty impressed if you somehow managed to say demonstrate that some rich arab who hate the west having his account frozen mean there would have been more attack after but you can try if you like a for the second paragraph those are the same thing it s an ad hom fallacy whether you think it s justified or not neckbeard progressive lol ok you re the one who s the yugioh expert with a name that i assume is something to do with some card game you re also the guy that a far a i can tell ha some insult in almost every single comment you ve posted on reddit which is a common neckbeard stereotype i ll say again watch the power of nightmare it s a bbc documentary not some fringe farleft conspiracy and adam curtis make the case quite convincingly that al qaeda were talked up a a major threat to the usa much like the soviet union were long after they d stopped being anything close to a superpower to justify the usa s other aim such a obviously in the gulf war case oil
NONE i do nt think it s a good idea to base anything on the manifesto of crazy people i think you re equating a scientificallybacked principle with a symbol of a defunct rebel government it sound like what you re saying is that because someone ha killed in the name of x x should not be taught or celebrated in fact i think you d be hard pressed to find a principle that someone hasnt killed someone over just about every religion fit this bill a well a every governmental system if you try to sus out the one that ha nt had any blood spilled you d be a silly a that scene from rain man in the airport dustin hoffman s character wo nt get on a plane because they all have had crash the only one that ha nt at the time of the film wa qantas which doe nt go where he need to be natural selection is the idea that those best fit to their environment will survive through adversity that s all it s not moral or immoral it s amoral just a amoral a the idea that water is made up of two hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom the confederate flag wa a symbol used today to harken back to a group of rebel imo racist whether it symbolizes heritage hate or a heritage of hate can be argued but that is nt scientific
AH you are a crazed liberal who doe nt understand shit
NONE do you also dislike science because of what it extremist can do
AH ya lol i wa born and raised in a city just a you were clearly born and raised in a barn though hopefully not all five of your neighbour were it s not very common for people to do a ° do you know what that mean and if you think just because you were born in a track most likely to keep you out in the boonies with your green thumb stuck up your as you re an idiot
NONE but what if seeing them show you something ha changed and now a friendship make more sense you had a moderate amount in common and now that you both have a five year old that shoot up to a lot or you used to be kinda stuck up but always friendly with them but now you see past their stupid clothes or now that you moved to albuquerque you do nt have a many friend a when you were a high school kid in new york
AH way to discus the main point are you trolling because you are sure a hell not trying to understand what you are being told
NONE while i agree with you supporter should nt be to blame many are starting to realise their mistake in electing who they did
AH unemployment obama started counting unemployment differently than any previous administration so that he d look like he s made improvement when in fact he s made thing worse he decided to remove people from the unemployed count who were no longer actively looking for work those that were jobless and happy to stay that way because of his entitlement just did nt get counted so if you re only looking at the percentage of people employed against those plus those looking then you get a very fake but high number that are employed essentially obama wa lying about the unemployment rate and libtards such a yourself believe that he s a miracle worker tell me some more about how smart you are i want a good laugh before bed
NONE i do nt know what the arrangement is in your country but in some country the goverenment pay the employer to employ mentally disabled people so it s not costing your employer anything to give ricky a job whether he actually doe any work or not it s just somewhere for him to go each day so that he might be able to do something other than sit at home and claim welfare benefit directly if he did nt have this job that s what he would be doing so maybe he doe a little bit of work sometimes which is useful and maybe he is le bored than he would be at home so it benefit everyone maybe he is not held to the same standard a regular employee because the company is nt paying him like they are paying you
AH so basicaly you were knowingly a piece of shit conquering other country that did nothing to you and murdering their people on their homeland
NONE i agree with you just let people be people and live their life however they want to live then a long a noone is hurting anyone else
AH what a tepid and sad response you are wrong on this one
NONE do we really need to have this same discussion every week
AH ok i m going to assume by your bizarre question that you re still in middle school and try to explain this to you in another way let s say you move in with your significant other and eventually have kid together but you decide not to get married do you think there s going to be fewer potential problem you d be wrong she could still leave you and she could still take half your stuff hell she could take more than half you could come back and find most of the apartment empty you think the police would care they d just say it wa a civil affair and since you were nt married the court would nt help that much either at least with a divorce there s a formal process for dividing the asset unmarried but living together you ll get screwed over she could still take the kid and make you pay child support a lot of guy believe that the court already favor the mother and to the extent that is true it s even worse for the unmarried father because it s easy for the older tradition based judge to consider him irresponsible if you live together a a couple there s quite a few benefit you are missing out on see here http wwwforbescomsiteskateashforddecidingnottogetmarried fbde for an idea so you really are nt cutting your odds of potential bad thing happening to you but you are cutting benefit that would come with a marriage
NONE yes you can say this for a lot of relationship i ve just gotten the impression that it s worse if you re living together just because of all the bullshit you put up with with one person having to move out and sleep in a separate room in the mean time the more involved a relationship is the more awkward it is to leave it this is true whether it s living together having the same friend taking class together whatever that s not a reason to not get involved if you got married and then broke up it would be even worse also it s possible to have an exit strategy i moved in with my so a bit over a year ago i probably would nt have say moved with him to another city i did nt know anybody but if we break up i can grab what i need and be at my sister s place in a halfhour that s not to say that the relationship is in a place that i think need this but if we re making decision on the possibility of it sucking when we break up we might a well consider our option can i ask how serious a relationship you ve been in because what tends to happen for a lot of longterm couple is that they re practically living together already at the point that they make this decision they re spending most night s at the other person s place and only go back to their apartment to get thing they need and the whole havingseparateplaces thing becomes a hassle plus sharing rent with someone is wicked but if you re young you re probably not ready for til death do u part so living together is the most practical thing
AH if you are unable to see nuance if the huge difference between not wanting representation and lashing out at unfair treatment a opposed to attacking because the candidate you did not back won the election and had not even taking office then there is help for you quoting the biggest exploiter of outright racism and the southern strategy really show how big of a fool you are reagan literally changed party after the civil right era shook up everything anybody who even show any regard for the domestic terrorist that fought almost exclusively for the right to own a human being is obviously to far gone to ever begin to see how much racism is still the forefront of the republican party after the civil right era i am quite frankly done arguing even the most basic historical point with somebody unable to grasp such basic fact and nuance
NONE i support the idea behind the act someone in another reddit thread long ago pointed out that we live in a country where there are so many rule and regulation that you re probably breaking one or two at any given moment whether you re charged on any of them is simply a matter of pissing off the wrong person this seems to be attempting to make some headway in regard to that exact problem but it doe nt attack the problem at it source a the article you linked to point out it seems that the only real effect of this act will be to make it easier for white collar criminal to weasel out of being prosecuted for taking part in shady activity they knew were wrong but were nt necessarily sure were illegal or worse yet slip out of a conviction because even though they knew the activity wa illegal it could nt be conclusively proven
AH stab wound are less survivable than gunshot wound wrong again they re much more likely to fuck up your internal organ than a bullet you hear little about that that s because people have access to gun if they did nt it d be knife people go with the easiest method and that s currently gun if they did nt have gun they would stab people go look into mass killing in southeast asia or africa there s plenty of mass killing by machete cop know the risk is a foolhardy argument too and ok fine here s the scenario played out people are robbing a store they have knife cop arrive on scene without gun they can not safely apprehend criminal criminal are trapped in store because cop are at front criminal go to front of store and attack cop cop are stabbed die en route to hospital so do criminal if the cop had gun they would ve been in a much safer position stand behind car block entrance keep weapon pointed at entrance and tell criminal that if they come out without hand up they will be shot wait for backup
NONE in the u you can buy a weapon at every corner without having much more than an id card i live in vermont so you re essentially right that i wa able to go in to a gun shop give the guy my id wait minute pay and then leave with a gun but i still had to pas a background check i had to prove that i m not a criminal lesser weapon mean lesser weapon you could get threated by if this were true i might be ok with some more restriction but a it stand it is not true look at nyc and chicago most of the gun violence committed in those city is committed by gang member using illegal gun these are still going to be the people out robbing and assaulting innocent victim but the law will not keep the gun out of their hand just look at those two city they have very strict gun law and yet the gang violence is still pretty bad the law are supposed to keep the gun out of the city but all they do is keep them out of the hand of law abiding citizen citizen that can no longer defend themselves because the criminal still have gun the odds that you are threated by a weapon are very low so all it take is one bad runin if you are in a life threatening situation and you have no mean to defend yourself then you are more likely to die you only get one turn on this merrygoround called life i refuse to get off because some asshole decided i wa his target you may be willing to go down without a fight but i m not
AH nope you re just an idiot good on ya mate gold star
NONE i think it s a big deal just how awful it is lol
AH oh you must be ottoman douchecunt
NONE i do not wish to cyv you are spot on
AH the real question is what make you think it ha any evolutionary biologist know that you re full of shit too i do not believe they are genetically more inclined no the statement really doe nt even make any sense
NONE it seems like you re arguing something different than the premise of your cmv i got the impression from your op that your position is that these term do nt apply but you seem to be saying here that they do apply they re just not important those are two different thing
AH oh sorry i injured your sensitive sensibility a long a those culture are nt made up of pussy like you then i promise they do nt give a fuck what you call them
NONE i think you are right obesity is unhealthy yet we cater to fat people so we do nt hurt their feeling you what really hurt their feeling a fucking heart attack
AH you re stupidly arrogant kant mill aristotle and many other great ethical thinker all think your wrong so my perception is only skewed towards the most common school of thought in the western cannon
NONE it s strange to me that so very many of these response have nothing to do with op some sort of reflexive argumentation going on for the sake of defending abortion really not the quality i normally see in cmv
AH what how in the living hell did we just jump to islam this is very very sloppy troll work not taking the bait
NONE there is sooo much made up victim complex crap in this thread it almost funny i guess people see what they want to see
AH why would you latch on an outlier instead of the average because old data averaged over a year period is nt particularly helpful if it is nt inflation adjusted more recent data is better the most recent data say billion net why did you say it wa million misrepresentation or misunderstanding so you refuse to answer of my argument except by a blanket dismissal you do nt make an argument your post is mostly hyperbole deliberate misrepresentation and strawmanning i m on cmv for worthwhile discussion not to engage in multi post block quote battle with someone who is obviously dogmatic and ignorant
NONE i do nt expect you to do my homework for me but the case you have presented is so far just a single datapoint right but you phrased your cmv a it is not possible therefore a single datapoint does disprove it that wa nt a tip for the future it wa a problem with your current cmv if you want a more general case though what about people who take antidepressant those people start those medication with the goal of regaining happiness a soon a possible and often that s necessary to go on living at all which of course is a prerequisite for success the nimh estimate of the population deal with major depression certainly that constitutes a significant trend
AH sorry babe but i have acknowledged that continue reading
NONE thanks i figured a much i did nt bother reading her last comment
AH you re right i dont like it when people advocate for systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing of me and my family and that s just a bad a smoking marijuana in fact i literally ca nt tell the difference new cmv it is ethically permissible to use violence against nazi white supremacist klan member and stoner s
NONE why to explain why it s use cause and perpetuates injustice in that limited scope you re still insisting on ignoring the myriad other injustice people face under systemic racism in favor of fixating on this one but in general i guess kinda it s easier to say to a bigot you dothinksay x towards people you see a black
AH ok it getting late the feminazis have won this round
NONE it s fucking terrible i d give it a out of match
AH and now we see the true color revealed i feel really dumb having been tricked into trying to argue with you please step off of your high horse and drop the arrogance down several notch
NONE i agree if you cut off their microphone and they knew it wa going to happen they may not hmm and haw or answer a different question at the front and then go over to eventually get to the question
AH you re an idiot see freedom of speech and the evil of humanity grow up and deal with the world not being fair or nice it make the good moment worth it
NONE your perception and opinion matter this view is a good example of this with your perception and opinion of the world you have made it so nothing in the entire world matter
AH you waste your time making baseless assertion like that this assertion is based on your response now do you want to answer my question or do you want to continue shifting the conversation i have no idea what you are thinking or asking when you exchange one completely different word for another he is doing something that is mutually beneficial so you would like to believe it s just not true if you see something immoral about two people agreeing to trade good i explained it to you but you confused physiological for psychological this is your deficit not mine stop pretending you are nothing but a parrot with no understanding
NONE what is yourself i know that sound abstract but when we re trying to use absolute term to understand how one experience or activity or pharmacological compound affect u versus another we have to start to ask that question to gain any precision and it turn out the answer is not very clear at all are you still yourself if you re sleepy are you still yourself if you are in fact completely asleep if not then yourself is apparently mutable enough for the question not to matter much right and if so if you are yourself when you re sleeping then i would argue that you re still fundamentally yourself on medication too you re just a yourself with perhaps altered mood or perception
AH hahah hydrocodine is a painkiller you moron again trying to be insulting and you fail again just stop you made a fool out of yourself again also i only started hydrocodine today hour ago so i m not addicted but i m glad you are looking out for me always nice i would prefer to have an intelligent person looking out for me but it s whatever d my wish is you research more and become smarter so that bloated ego will actually have some back up behind it if you ever wan na talk about why you have an ego i m all ear we can work you through this extremely high egotism together a a team it will be the first time you won anything on the internet d to bad your victory will be over yourself so technically you lost to yourself but it s whatever right also if an idiot you are a compete black hole of intelligence sucking in information and vanishing it to never be reached again you are useless a an arguer my pet rock had more potential then you do
NONE how much are you willing to fight for the relationship unfortunately at least in my opinion you two are at different stage either you ll be willing to give it a shot or you are nt if you are willing to fight for the relationship even in the event that it turn out it suck and you ll split up later go for it or the opposite you do nt have enough faith that this will work and solve your problem it will only mask it you do nt truly believe that this will work and it will just be a stepping stone move on now before it becomes hostile i know this is cmv but this is a question you have to answer do you think you can get over this for the time being and more importantly it will actually solve the problem if yes you have to take a jump and realize that even if it doesnt solve the problem that you were willing to fight for her in your life
AH i ll break it down into baby step since apparently that is required in the op you said this doe not cover x and that s fine but in mentioning that you completely ignored their other point i want you to respond to them this subreddit is not an echo chamber where you get to voice your unpopular opinion and ignore all who dare to oppose this is a subreddit where you go to change your opinion i understand you re being up front about one part the other part is completely ignored that s outrageously intellectually dishonest i used to pull that shit all the time i can smell it from a mile away do nt try to hide it and i told you to pipe down buhbye friendo real mature how old are you because i do nt think anyone over the age of besides my mom ha told someone to fuck off for daring to call them out for fucking up like i said above this is not an echo chamber you re here to have your view changed not to mention how much of an asshole thing that is to say seriously rule do nt be a dick we re nice people here edit i mean if telling people to fuck off is acceptable to you then i d like to kindly ask you to fuck off from this sub if you ca nt follow it rule and spirit
NONE i m not going to argue that there are nt occasion where one need to know how to strategically lie i m going to say that you do nt need to be taught that a a child most all of u were taught a kid that lying is wrong and honesty is the best policy etc etc and yet every single one of u recognizes that sometimes you should lie either to protect yourself or to protect someone s feeling from being unnecessarily hurt or some other reason it s just something that you reason out on your own so rather than trying to logically explain to a kid when it is and is nt okay to disregard the rule about honesty i think it s best to just encourage them to be honest and let them figure out for themselves that sometimes it s smarter to lie personally i told my wife i look forward to the first time my kid consciously lie i think it s a pretty big milestone mentally to recognize that there are consequence to your word to recognize that you have the choice of what to say and to strategically choose to lie even if he suck at it and he will at first i think that s a pretty big step putting all of that together

AH holy shit man you are fucking thick your response to that comment wa not a persuasive argument your response wa not an argument at all it wa a single sentence with no grounding or logic to back it up there is literally nothing for me to respond to at this point in time jfc i give up
NONE i agree with your premise a a professional lazy this happens to be something i ve thought about a bit in the past would you agree that a scenario in which a person is forced to sit is more unjust than one in which a person is forced to lie down with essentially the same reasoning
AH stupid nigger you think it better to learn any language regardless of how worthless it is just so you can say you know another language
NONE given the ambiguity then is it fair to say that you should nt assume they re your enemy because they might have a slightly more nuanced view
AH no way woman take too long and make way bigger mess in nighttime venue i d be okay with a urinal only room but that would be sexist this would double woman s available stall and move the urinal somewhere unobtrusive i get really butthurt over the intersectionality of sexism and efficiency a a side note if the silhouette on the door make you uncomfortable rather than merely aware of the situation you might have mental problem give it an hour i ll bet you ll feel more comfortable with any available shitter
NONE a a woman i would do everything in my power not to train in any capacity without a proper supportive bra i would much rather have extra laundry than suffer through my boob flying all over the place for extended period of time and i do nt even have big boob apart from that you re ignoring the part where our society is nt in a place where nudity is considered a something absolutely normal on the contrary i agree that some rule should nt be a strict a they are but having a bunch of people naked in a gym is pushing it
AH you have an extremely childish view of the world people most people are a much interested in power a money and this is one way to perpetuate their power and oppression the fact that you are acting a their sycophant doe nt mean you are not oppressed you just place blame in the wrong direction
NONE the only people you will find disagreeing with your sentiment not the clumsy racially charged way in which you made it will be right winger and libertarian talking about personal choice and freedom whilst ignoring the state intervention that allowed those people to become poor and ignorant in the first place
AH i never said that it wa more worthy than a real living person in fact i made the suggestion that abortion should be allowed for some reason you act a though your kid will be born again when in reality you are killing your kid and replacing it abortion is nt postponing the birth of a child it is killing a child and allowing a woman to decide if she want another one also killing your child over a birth defect is sickening if it is nt a mercy kill people with down s syndrome are still just a much people a you or i pffffft you think i am oppressing woman by not allowing them to murder their child if it wa their own fault they got pregnant hilarious rape mean you did nt consent to a child and would be traumatized by having it something that would not change with a shift of moral anyways it really is nt systemic at all since the government still ha nt outlawed abortion go try and claim oppression point elsewhere unless it is for your personal health no you should nt kill weed if you are tending to a garden then you may kill weed because garden help ease stress if they throw off the balance of nature invasive specie then they are fair game for the good of the environment if law enforcement doe nt try to stop illegal abortion i do nt see how your previous source wa relevant anyways that is current law enforcement surely it can be improved to stop it through funding also a shift in moral in society will cause more people to see abortion a wrong
NONE for it to be hypocritical would require it to be inconsistent i m very prochoice but this position is perfectly tenable for starter we are talking about direct harm v indirect harm and if that is the material consequence to a person in the matter of abortion then they certainly are nt being hypocritical to the prolifer an abortion is equatable to putting a gun to a person s head and shooting them to death if that s the part they find abhorrent then it s not hypocritical for them to then also not care about public subsidy because everyone can always make an effort to improve their circumstance but someone taking the opprotunity to have circumstance ie murder is materialistically different but are they doing anything to support orphanage and the safe and easy adoption of unwanted child if they re against social program for the poor are nt they making it harder for a single mom to raise the child in reality they may be inadvertently sentencing that child to a harder life than they should have but the point is they are alive to the prolifer if you are alive you can always attempt to improve your situation if you were terminated before birth you did nt really have a say in the matter when arguably you probably should have like i said initially i m prochoice but the prolife position is perfectly reconciled you sacrifice certain thing to reconcile it but ultimately every ideological position requires you to give up something to accept it a superior very few if any position are so overtly superior that you ca nt make a feasible argument to the contrary
AH i simply answered your question and now you re saying i m off topic you re trash at debating this is why hillary lost
NONE what are you doing down here this is way too good a point to be this low hope you ve upvoted my comment then

NONE some of them could be but they have to be balanced and credible or else reasonable people wo nt listen or take them seriously
AH i have no idea who that is even after looking at his wiki page nor do i care when i follow my nature i m kind friendly helpful forgiving and generous it s not only against my nature to be a bully i consciously do nt want to be something i see a inherently negative i ve wasted enough time with you to see that you are nt able to step out of your own experience and view thing from another point of view if you currently live by this principle i hope one of your victim ha enough of your shit and show you the error of your way go fuck yourself
NONE i will confess i do nt think anyone needs to watch anything but there are a few reason to watch it with a different outlook it s actually a great story about resilience making amends for past transgression and being courageous against the odds it really challenge the definition of what justice is and a transformation of a dude that had every reason to just fold it s set to some catchy tune which you can sing to and dance to if you so wish if you can get yourself around these really powerful theme i think you ll find it far from bland edit minor grammar
AH his mother is jewish wa raised catholic identifies a a jew from his own word you retarded cunt

AH people like you are the reason america suck and yes i m serious gun right nutjobs advocate deserve no credence in modern civil society you should nt need any more convincing for this cmv than the first response i already saw here but since you re an nra cardcarrying nutcase the fact that gun are only a weapon while car are almost always a mean of survival first and a weapon only in extreme circumstances will surely be lost on you gun kill people car kill people vending machine kill people of the three which are used safely and for the benefit of people of the time and which are only possibly ever used to hurt and kill people no no difference i guess you re right time to start licensing vending machine hey joe can you buy me a snicker you have a vending machine license right sorry bob my license got suspended when i tried to kill somebody with a vending machine last week
NONE thank you for your answer your solution they seem smart but i d just like to point one more thing like i said earlier imagine you are the president there is a horrible school shooting hundred are dead legally purchased assault rifle what do you dosay so we both seem to agree that just offering condolence after huge tragedy seems empty especially since the problem is ongoing okay so you need action to establish that something ha to change this can not continue but your action even though they might address bigger point in the gun violence problem hardly seem like solution in the aftermath of school shooting or the like fellow american the tragedy is great and therefore i will ban gunfree zone and stop the war on drug and antipolice bias the realpolitik here is that those are not the solution the nation want or maybe even need a far a healing process go saying that bad guy get gun le often is good politics
AH lol i bet you re a prepper too

NONE not only is it possible it s not even that unlikely http wwwoptionsforsexualhealthorgbirthcontrolpregnancybirthcontroloptionseffectiveness birth control effectiveness is measured per year so you actually have about a chance of getting someone pregnant in year if you have a vasectomy http wwwnytimescominteractivesundayreviewunplannedpregnancieshtml a woman getting her tube tied ha a chance of getting pregnant in year
AH you are stupid since you all are obsessed with rape i ll focus on that although i have other reason feminist seem to think that just because we do nt automatically believe an accuser that we support rape idiot and it wa feminist who cried about virtual rape by a few hacker in a game full of virtual murder by the game s design and because the bitch were too stupid to find the off button sorry but if i wa ever raped why would it affect my view of myself i unlike these feminist see myself a more than a vagina so it would not destroy me if there were no other factor violencegetting beat upstdpregnancy why would i see it a something about me the rapist is an asshole that s all it mean again feminist screech about rape constantly when there s many worse thing and it impossible to get a zero rape rate it s already down from the s although feminist will lie and say it went up since then so yeah for these reason and many others feminist are stupid i mean modern feminism so do nt try that idiocy you all usually pull about we got the vote even that wa nt by feminism in the current sense of the word
NONE it s almost always met with downvotes and something about how since feminist are nt actively campaigning against these extremist then that mean they must support them i have nt seen anything like this so i do nt know what to say to this i do nt get how that counter my view because in tia if someone post a satire blog people say that s a satire blog you idiot and anyone who visit the thread can see those comment in sr if someone link to an obvious joke post there will be no comment in the thread saying that wa clearly a joke because any such comment will be deleted and their poster may be banned i ve also seen a fair amount of people and been one of those people in tia who say actually the post you linked ha a really good point and get upvotes and good discussion whereas this is explicitly against the mission of sr yeah that wa one thing i liked about the sub at first but since it s gotten bigger i feel like it s become a losing battle they just programmed automod to remind people and had a mod post about satire blog recently they at least are trying unlike sr

NONE uh thanks you re right in the sense that cisness can normally be assumed so there s no need to mention it say in your facebook about me section but that there s a time and a place when it is very useful some people will abuse it because some people adore any and all label they can apply to themselves but nobody reasonable would say you need to use it for yourself unless it s somehow relevant to the conversation that you re ci or talking about ci people and not trans
AH everything you say is spun and bullshit i could spin it the other way with people who circumcise a adult being so sensitive jean hurt and you cum in second and yada yada yada but i m too lazy tl dr you re defending your ugly cheesy penis
NONE if circumcision meant cutting the head of the penis off and maybe sewing up your ball so you ca nt ejaculate until you need to have a baby then they could be thought of in a similar way but yes it is pretty pointless and it only real point is to make it harder to jerk off which is totally shitty
AH you are actually hurting animal by not eating the meat here that s idiotic i guess i m hurting you by not eating you because you re such an idiot edit being rude is against the rule that doe nt make sense am i hurting you by not eating you

AH the state relgion ha no impact on anyone the only thing i know that happens because of it is prayer are said at the start of the day in westminster palace lord the god of righteousness and truth grant to our queen and her government to member of parliament and all in position of responsibility the guidance of your spirit may they never lead the nation wrongly through love of power desire to please or unworthy ideal but laying aside all private interest and prejudice keep in mind their responsibility to seek to improve the condition of all mankind so may your kingdom come and your name be hallowed amen the house of common the lord have a longer prayer but their house is made up member strong of cofe bishop what about the people of wale dick also the national religion in scotland is the church of scotland further catholicsa are nt the majority in northern ireland where did you read that the queen ha no power in state affair so her being the head of the church doe nothing
NONE you are thinking of this issue from your perspective instead think of this issue of society s perspective society is established for several reason these reason include the management of thing public service like road security the military and safety the police prison the member of the society create an institution to manage these thing collectively so that each member of the society can go along with his business in peace this is society member of society are entitled to absolute freedom except where society agrees that freedom should be limited for example you are not free to murder another person you are also not free to shout fire in a theater society ha decided that they will not allow you to kill yourself they have taken that freedom away from you a a member of society the society will do everything in it power to prevent you from committing suicide it s not about your right and freedom it s about what society want it s that simple
AH i think you should stop being a dick
NONE i think you might have a point
AH im so glad trump won mainly to see warped leftist like yourself get a big slap on the back of the head and a wake up call your way of thinking is too divorced from reality a a white male what the hell it s because you have money not because you are white you racist identity politics guy do you know the difference between causation and correlation or who care right a long a you virtue signal nothing is more pathetic to watch then someone apologising for their success it doe nt make poor people feel any better if you feel so bad then give your money to the needy
NONE you would be surprised how good forgiving someone can feel it really doe take a lot sometimes but in the end holding onto the anger and hatred is only hurting you and that s not just a platitude it really doe hurt to hold onto hate sometimes it s better to say fuck the dumb shit and let it go now if a person is actively engaged in causing you harm that is one thing but once they are no longer a threat to you holding onto the anger is nt constructive this doe nt mean let your guard down around them if you think they might revert to their old way you can forgive and not forget
AH oh my king of king please allow me to prostrate myself at your foot in respect of the astounding revelation you present how i am unable to understand the depth and nuanced way that you conveyed that this argument is terrible this can be interpreted in a plethora of way and only those with the intellect of the philosopher of the age could interpret the many meaning and subtle message contained within you then provided so much more infinitesimally fine detail in your latter communiqué the fact that there is a general consensus on moral parameter set within our society is plainly obvious with the smooth and cordial discourse amongst both our noble representative and the mass please accept my most humble apology and allow me to continue in this most noble of forum or just fuck off
NONE let me preface this with a caveat i ve never read the book you re reading and thus may miss some thing why in your view must meaning extend itself to a universal level i agree that if we look at ourselves from a perspective that ignores the limit of human life that everything is essentially meaningless that said when viewed within the scope of our existence it no longer becomes difficult to find meaning in thing our interaction an relationship with other people feel immensely meaningful the connection between ourselves and nature the cyclicality of life the dependence of all thing on another inspires both beauty and meaningfulness in many people my point here is that perhaps you are looking at thing on far too large of a scale by doing so are dooming yourself to never appreciate the meaning that can be found in thing when approached from a humancentric perspective
AH give me a delta you sonova bitch i changed your view because you believed i did not have your view now you believe what i say is unassailable unless someone ha the gumption to put me on my as because that s where i belong or maybe not

AH there is a difference between studying history and celebratingdevoting a national holiday to a man who committed the mass extermination and enslavement of a race of people and raped their woman it s what make the whole dear leader supreme commander adoration in north korea so absurd clearly kim jong un is still in power but the rest of the world acknowledges him a a dictator under whom atrocity have taken place btw platitude and deal with it are nt really argument for cmv maybe you should stick with sub like radviceanimals or even rpolitics if you ca nt manage a cogent and logical response
NONE it s a little silly to talk about a right to secede without talking about practicality you could say that every human ha a right to own a pony if you disregard the practicality of feeding housing and exercising the horse the valid reason to support the policy is that no one want a world war and supporting the policy keep taiwan independent a long a they play the one china game there is no other option other than a taiwan that s completely under control of the prc that s a lot better than supporting the week of independence that they d get before being crushed if they openly defied china
AH no anarchy mean no ruler not no rule try harder next time
NONE there s no changing it now so maybe a rtruefitness is needed
AH but why should i respect their belief i know for a fact that there are many belief i do nt respect are these people saying i should pretend to respect them if so why surely if i disagree with something i should voice that disagreement regardless of who might get offended sure you can do that people like that are what people call douchebags or dicks if you do nt want people to be friendless then do nt be a dick if you do nt want friend then do whatever you want
NONE no offense meant because we all have it to some extent but that sound like personal prejudice i would recommend asking yourself why it bother you so much were you taught to believe it s wrong are you not comfortable with your own sexuality there could be many reason and it may benefit you psychologically to explore that unfortunately since it is nt based in logic it s not something i can effectively argue against so i do nt think i can change your view but i wish you luck
AH you are very clearly the one who is out of touch thinking we can make a mental choice to move on from a major terrorist attack let me give you an example your sjw mind might be able to comprehend after a woman is raped do you tell her to just move on without taking step to find and punish the attacker do you suggest we construct large safe space that the terrorist are not allowed to attack u in
NONE why would that same rule not apply with someone from the middle east being a queer dude in the u can be dangerous sometimes i know you learn how to drop hint and to back off and remove yourself from the situation if necessary so why open yourself up to so many false negative by assuming ethnicity ha anything to do with anything just pay attention to the sign you already pay attention to
AH quit being a pussy then
NONE swearing is for fucking cunt
AH you re using right and wrong a synonym for correct and incorrect where one is a value judgment stemming from a deeply felt set of moral and the other a statement of veracity english is tough motherfucker
NONE i mean i think you re right that the other way is more common but this stance is just an excuse to not care and this stance is most but not all of the time an excuse to not care are meaningfully different

NONE so you do think we act wrongly if we do nt sit and watch the ad a good rule of thumb is that if everyone doing it would result in something you do nt like it s probably a bad idea i do nt play sport but i enjoy watching them if everyone behaved a i did then i would nt be able to enjoy watching sport doe it follow that it s probably a bad idea for me not to play sport
AH i apologize for suggesting that people should learn about thing before making declarative statement on those thing the entire point of this sub is to let people make a declarative statement about a topic and then invite people to explain to them why they re wrong you re just trying to shut the conversation down by demanding an unreasonable amount of research and investigation be done before making an informal post on an open discussion board i ll bet that you would nt have been happy with any amount of prior research simply because op ha a different opinion than you you re being overly hostile to someone who is clearly sticking their neck out to learn a different perspective your type of rhetoric is what encourages people to maintain their current viewpoint rather than change them through healthy civil debate congratulation you re not helping anything in fact you re making thing worse that make you an asshole more than you can imagine then maybe you should nt be standing on your imaginary soapbox lecturing people
NONE i mistakenly believed there wa a rule against giving the op of a thread a delta i edited my post to add it do you think this would make up for the other restriction in their life it s subjective so no one could really say you could just a well ask if having a le restricted life make up for risking poverty violence and other danger here on earth the point is that this would make life on the ship tolerable if we assume that it is immoral to give a child a lessthanideal life then the life we should give them is what exactly how do you think their imagination would take all this and process it i m not sure i understand what you re asking i imagine activity like the one we re engaged in now would be common meditating on and debating idea that exist only in fiction from our point of view keeping score in various way to add some sense of accomplishment to the whole process at least that would be one example a lot of people already seem to live online and find no shortage of creative andor social activity to occupy the mind
AH your being the devil advocate just for the heck of it dick
NONE no it would nt that s just a matter of the used number system
AH coffee and tea lack calorie wat that s asinine and untrue

NONE thanks for the delta although you should make your comment a little longer for deltabot to recognize it
AH hey hey we are limiting our service but if you pay u dollar a month we ll give you the same stuff we were giving you for free but wait let u discus why that s an awesome deal for our user have you tried you know actually read the fucking post that op made instead of discussing why the argument op made is wrong let s just accuse him of being an astroturfer let s discount the probability that maybe some people can look at thing objectively and have concluded that it s not so bad nope it s clearly an astroturfer maybe you could fuck off with your idiotic accusation of astroturfing no it s not marketing that s slimier it s just that you re just an idiot then again maybe you re not an idiot and you re probably hired by tinder rival to try and smear them
NONE and if you think the price is too high for what it is worth pirating is still a dick move that s denying revenue to someone who deserves it we re disagreeing on what deserves it mean i would posit that a company that make a good game deserves income one that make an irredeemably bad one deserves to have the game mocked and to only make money for the first couple of day before word get out i would agree that you should just not waste your time on it rather than pirate it but the fact that we vote with our wallet and do nt want to incentivize this sort of bad game design can have something to do with that decision a well sending the message if you re going to make a game this bad we ll only play it for free and then just to mock it is i think a valid one
AH i never mentioned rape there is a huge difference but liberal like to use that argument when i am talking about two consenting adult hence when i said couple your just an as i never mentioned that scenario in that case it is up to the woman to decide
NONE so i m not sure the distinction make a difference he doe nt have to consider the other option yet he still arrives at the same conclusion by holding true to his belief if he ha those belief what s wrong with holding true to them in this situation
AH man you are an idiot in every thread are nt you
NONE yep anyone can award one if they re view is changed
AH poor female doe not produce anywhere near the same crime rate if you re going to reply at least bother to read what you re responding to the concept of an interaction is messy and hard to understand though so i ll forgive you if it take a minute
NONE the point i am trying to make is that you should never say i am unwilling to reconsider my view even if you provide all evidence necessary to do so that s true but it seems like a substantially weaker claim than the claim you were making in the op
AH i m not sure if you re unintentionally missing my argument or just plain trying to misrepresent what i m arguing either way i came here for counterpoint not to teach someone basic reading comprehension
NONE sure i m happy to agree to disagree but i m still a bit curious and i apologise if i ve misinterpreted what you ve said but do you consider acapella song to be music or is music to you something that requires an instrument
AH found alex jones reddit everyone you ve got ta be joking you fucktard lol
NONE i m sorry ur obviously know more than me on this y did i not fink of dat
AH i do nt know anything about that because those subculture are nt my thing but feel free to create imaginary voice in your head i wo nt stop you anyhow more to the point what s hyperbolic something in regarding the point made you re not that naive are you average american awareness of instability in our geopolitical circumstance the deepening shit that society the world is getting itself into one day at a time are increasingly beyond our capacity to control it ps also i did nt say my autocorrect wa my favorite just le bothersome than a random stranger on the internet someone s sarcasm detector is broken
NONE hi there i have been suicidally depressed so i guess i m in a position to address some of your point and here s the really important thing that you seem to be overlooking people who try to commit suicide are generally not in a healthy state of mind when you re depressed your world view becomes twisted and distorted and what s obvious to most people might not necessarily be obvious to a person with depression it s a sickness of the mind i had the sincerest belief that killing myself would make the world a better place i absolutely believed that nobody loved me and so nobody would miss me if i were gone
AH what quota filling brigade there no such thing a a quota for removing child how about i clarify for you idiotic nonbelievers who think cps is the salvation of mankind and not another bloated useless government po that did happen to pay their support staff very well i said no such thing a unwritten quota wa in effect for completed case not removing child never said such a thing a completed is an investigated and closed case whether or not it involved removing child technically police department do nt have quota on speeding ticket either but apparently everyone speed more at the end of the month
NONE i m not at all arguing you should be arrested i agree that s silly but you said there should be no legal repercussions that s different you agree cp is illegal for good reason and i think you see the logic of my point about the source being at least somewhat irrelevant so some repercussion would be appropriate no how about a mandatory education course on sexting and data security akin to driver education course given a penalty for texting and driving surely you can see that a legal repercussion of this kind would be appropriate and practical and also serve a an acknowledgement of the inherent illegality of the cp itself
AH it s funny that your fall back position is to normalize your rationale by popularity to be a good communicator is simply to be widely understood you accused me of being a poor communicator and i demonstrated that this wa not the case you apparently agree with me that people would have understood my meaning so you agree that i wa communicating well i am not particularly embarrassed right not nor did i misread you since you did nt type anything to be misread if you specified your statement parameter perhaps i would be at fault but ala you put forth a broad statement riddled with logical fallacy you re just embarrassing yourself now give it a rest i said great wealth brings great responsibility and you claimed that somehow by that logic someone with ha a great responsibility to give away a large percentage of his wealth your deduction fails because in any real world scenario doe not constitute great wealth
NONE i would also say that it evidently depends on the child for example me and my sister responded differently to different punishment and should smacking prove to not be effective then obviously other method which showed themselves to be more so would be used you re correct my response show trend and likelihood you a a parent need to decide what is actually effective and since parent work best a a team whatever method of discipline you decide to use will be most effective if you and your partner were consistent if she doubt the value of smacking and if you re convinced by the trend that it is nt worth it then you should nt proceed after all you wo nt be able to detect the loss of trust without a control child anyway finally a a side not thank you for your response it is a very well laid out argument and definitely is making me exam my own reasoning you re welcome i liked doing the research if your view wa changed by the evidence i provided you could award me a delta you know positive reinforcement
AH you made a direct comparison to other candidate i did not you fucking jackass
NONE reddit taught you that you can use reddit to teleport please you got ta show me how that work
AH you are disgustingly childish
NONE delta actually these are lie
AH you should know by now having obviously spent some time on the internet that the tumblrstyle of anything is not a reality shared by nearly anyone outside tumblr fat acceptance doe nt mean the same thing on tumblr a it doe in the real world just like being otherkin is nt really a documented phenomenon outside tumblr or like how going by tumblr s example everyone and their grandmother is depressedbipolarschizophrenic it s a bunch of lost teenager who found a combination of other lost teenager and horrible troll living in an echo chamber if your source for your apparent assertion that some people believe all fat people are healthy and there s no reason for them to lose weight then you re being a moron there s no reason to believe that the tumblr view of the world is the real world
NONE the sort of people who want homosexual to pray away the gay are so set in their view that nothing will change their mind yes and no some of that crowd certainly but other people soften their view a bit when their gay uncle or friend or whoever come out and is nt a terrible person the gayness being inherently part of an otherwise good person is a crack in their world view in a way that the moral equivalent of i sure like my uncle but he ca nt stop robbing liquor store is nt so respectfully i think you have it backwards the point is nt making a weaker moral argument to the subset of people that a you say can not be reached the point is making an argument that is compelling to people in a gray area who can be reached
AH oh my god youre an idiot
NONE ur view is stupid lol
AH are you actually asking or just being an as
NONE so is beating someone for being different
AH then there is no hope for an intelligent conversation with you on the contrary if you had clearly detailed that from the get go we would nt be here it s important to distinguish between a vernacular use of a scientific term and what it actually entail regardless i m somewhat concerned that you re still trying to essentially call me stupid to try to win the argument just saying it is nt working maybe try making actual argument instead
NONE like urollingforinitiative pointed out the question at hand with gender essentially either legitimizes or delegitimizes someone s life this becomes especially problematic when these discussion start relating to policy i do nt believe that this is an issue that people should keep quiet on that is nt to say that we should nt aim to have this done in a polite way but i agree with udangerzone in that choosing not to do anything about it is choosing a side debate are healthy for society and they can be had without resorting to name calling
AH i just stopped responding to this guy he think he s some harvard edgelord supreme and think that people actually sit down and doe a page thesis for every possible opinion that one could have it s just a keyboard warrior who had little socialization growing up
NONE i m glad this argument finally turned up it s an interesting one i think to really get it across you should imagine that this wa a member of the last mating pair just about everybody would agree that a child s life is more important than a gorilla s but is a child s life worth more than the entire gorilla species
AH i must just be dumb i wholeheartedly agree for someone who seems so concerned with the context of this cmv i think it s hilarious that you ca nt seem to understand how questioning op s premise that and they would nt if it were nt for conservative constantly using it a a political talking point i think they know full well that the deficit is nt a big deal at the moment but they need you to feel afraid they might a well be saying the tower of pisa could fall any second and if they re voted in they ll stop it since no one else seems to care enough doe nt directly relate to hisher overall assertion
NONE it is just extremely hard to believe that the us fucked up on that level on why is that i do nt see how they messed up that badly we were attacked in an unprecedented and bizarre fashion and were unable to effectively respond in under an hour that seems pretty reasonable to me it certainly doe nt seem to be beyond reasonable for the vast majority of air force colonel a you only list one so unless they have bought into the lie i do nt understand your level of skepticism and the rest of your post is the same junk i ve already addressed unless you are willing to move this forward then i m done i m not going to do your job for you
AH because donald trump and all the inherited millionaire really earned their money whilst the poor child of a working mother who go out every day and work hour shift and still cry about money every night deserve to be poor shut the fuck up and get some compassion we are nt taking money from the poor and giving it to other poor the idea is to take money from the rich who have too much and let greed overpower them
NONE i think it is rude because ringing through a few item take only a few minute out of your day and it just common courtesy to put your phone away for a moment and say hi how are you and thank them cashier are human too and to me it the same thing a texting in the middle of a conversation with someone that person took the time to help youtalk to you you should acknowledge them and give them your attention
AH you are incomprehensible truth are not fact that is just a bullshit statement that doe nt mean anything there are innate difference in personality related to sex the evidence on that is very clear you call them stereotype but it s actually the exact opposite people have different personality woman are generally higher in neuroticism and openness that s not to say that all woman are but on average most are this is likely due to evolutionary adaptation of child rearing which come at a huge cost to woman you seem to be antievolution though so i do nt want to go into this too much either way the author of the memo ha now been fired which basically prof his point of google becoming “ a politically correct monoculture that maintains it hold by shaming dissenter into silence ” here http assetsdocumentcloudorgdocumentsgooglesideologicalechochamberpdf is also the full document with graph and source which you claimed he never provided ok now that that s settled i m going to go find an adult to talk to now
NONE heterosexual people do not exhibit such lewdness in parade except for that you totally http wwwsdmardigrascomwpcontentuploadsimagejpeg do http storagecalgarysuncomvdynamicresizeswspathsunsprodimagesoriginaljpg quality sizex you just do nt notice it because you re used to it the truth is that image that are intended to be sexually appealing to straight men consciously put there or not are everywhere it s so pervasive it s basically background noise when something becomes so ingrained a that it get easy to see it a just the normal right way of thing so much so that you do nt even really notice them anymore whereas deviation even if they re essentially the same thing get to be seen a wrong or noteworthy simply by virtue of you being awake to them add in the fact that pride parade are relatively uncommon the fact that the sexualization of them all the one ive ever been to at least is really overblown by the medium and others and the fact that they actually have a function and i m pretty comfortable saying this a a doublestandard on your part
AH ok i ll use small word go up look at my first post here where he knowingly ascribes sorry had to use big word negative quality to minority population that are blatantly provably untrue on multiple occasion he ha suggested violating civil right in the basis of race through what if he knew the term will be looked back on a repatriotation v he look back on the internment of japanese american in ww a inspiring not horrifying but no the wall he want to build had no basis in racism
NONE considering how much effort the medium had put into deifying him i suspect the lead on the story would have been something like despite the shining example set by nelson mandela the people of sa turned away from peace and turned to violence unless it happened while he wa president i think he would have been given credit rightly or wrongly for doing the best that could be done based on how all of the neighboring state performed in similar circumstance
AH edgy comment from a middle schooler why am i not surprised
NONE actually totally in agreement so far i am not getting my view changed either
AH no reason they need to be public other than the fact that not all people can afford to or will be willing to send their child to school some people are just asshole that do nt realize the value of even a modest education they need to be accounted for you think road just would nt exist without tax decent one no name one civilization in history that wa known for it private transportation infrastructure the roman the german the japanese the united state all government built seriously how old are you yes negatively impacted again how old are you what are you using to get this data out on the internet which wa invented using government funding there is no aspect of your life that is not positively impacted by the fact that you were able to get your good safely and efficiently produced well all a a result of government program but the public school have gone to shit law enforcement completely disregard our civil liberty and is no longer accountable to the general public and i think that just might have something to do with people like you thinking it s no longer up for debate whether or not these thing exist is not up for debate how to make them better is certainly something that can and is constantly be pursued i m pretty confident that you re a bit of a whack job who doe nt have any understanding of how the real world even function again how old are you
NONE warlarge scale conflict the solution you propose already exists it s called the usa the usa ha many time over the pwoer to destroy civilization a we know they can fight indefinitely against the whole world if necessary you really do nt get any more powerhouse than that problem is that s all useless modern modern warfare is about what you might call terrorism if your proposal wa adopted and a full power governemnt took over anyone who opposes it would be even more extreme they would literally be banned from earth itself instead of just a country or culture povertyfood insecurity you re absolutely right we have much more than we need however that s not the issue the issue is that people real people relevant people think that it s fine for some to be miserable while others are filthy rich if you think like that distributing wealth is straight up bad and this segment of society is nt irrelevant they would combat this idea with all their mighty these are two example that just bring to attention the real problem with a unique government people do nt agree there s no thing a right or correct different perspective go a deep a the conception of life itself you simply can not bring some people together because they disagree on fundamental concept
AH to be honest you sound disgusting
NONE to be fair pride in anything is silly
AH oh god you re right the cringe mundimori terf detected user like mundimori are a rare specie and only have the gut to shitpost on anonymous online forum

AH that s not what happned in vid hilarious you make up stuff to justify not being wrong typical lol heavy thing like the extra lbs the cop wa cry about maybe he is not fit for duty of he chooses to arrest a girl in bikini instead of two fit athletic attacker my bad wa not aware what a wuss you are
NONE my friend s kid doe nt run to the bey blade section of the store he run fast a fuck and not joking jump into stranger car in the parking lot they got him a leash and he ha nt been kidnapped since i do nt quite understand the point of the crate training but i m not a parent so do nt judge that decision
AH you need to stop falling back on you do nt understand the op it s understood i m saying you will not find a better angle until you empathize with people who do nt want child throughout this thread you come off a a callous knob who wo nt acknowledge that anyone s feeling are valid despite source saying that they are maybe the best angle is nt to be a fucking prick in front of those who are undecided compassion clearly is nt your thing which is incredibly ironic because it should be the strongest point against abortion
NONE when doe one have the right to be angry can you elaborate on that if someone ha the right to be angry when they feel grieved then you ca nt make any useful claim about that if someone ha the right to be angry when they may justifiably be grieved you can argue about justifiably a lot but animal cruelty and taking diversity from the earth would for me fall into that category if someone ha that right only when they have real damage i do nt think poaching qualifies for most people if you re only allowed to be angry when that is not hypocritical probably some people do have that right can you explain what exactly is needed to give someone the right to be angry
AH you must think you are so smart peppering your example with some white people so that we do nt notice that you want lifelong punishment for black people who commit a crime michelle jones spent over year in jail donna hylton spent both woman of color so any person with empathy can imagine the kind of treatment they endured and out of it they still came out productive member of society even in position most black people are denied by society because of bigotry but i guess that s what really piss you off woman of color being accepted to doctorate program being speaker in multitudinary march so let s build this ridiculous cmv to see if someone buy your poorly veiled racist rationalization for wanting to sabotage these woman keeping them in prison forever so that we can enslave them still what wa it that triggered you to lay your racism so bare wa it that cracker getting wrecked in seattle for harassing black people in the bus people realizing white racist are beyond help and no longer trying to justify them wa it all those white trash police officer and firefighter who are suspended or removed from the force for being racist and people calling for their ban from public service yeah breaking news for racist the difference between trailer trash like them and people like hylton and jones is abysmal anyone not so poisoned by racism can easily see that so stop embarrassing yourselves with these false equivalence post you ai nt slick
NONE racism doe nt die overnight it take decade of legislative reform and generation of social adjustment another point i d like to make is that child do nt just become adult which parrot the value of their authority figure people in the u seem to think that if a kid s favorite show doe nt have a black person in it they will become racist and if their doll are too perfect they will develop eating disorder insignificant thing that happen to child are nt going to mold their life s experience eventually they will become autonomous adult with their own judgement and a different social context for racism than ours maybe they will make a much bigger deal over it or maybe it will be so marginalized that they re dismissed entirely people are nt scared of the kkk or of neonazis anymore they re open and proud of their racism but they re so marginalized at this point that you barely ever hear about them instead you hear outrage and protesting because some celebrity or ceo said something mildly racist racism is a different thing now black people are nt being hunted down and lynched it s a lot le about what is said or done and a lot more about who said or did it there are institutional flaw that still need working through and cultural not racial divide that need closing but the future exists to repair those issue grandpa being grumpy at dinner because he saw the black waitress s white boyfriend pick her up after her shift is not going to evoke any kind of cultural change it s oldschool thinking that isnt propagating
AH this is why people do nt want to offend woman s feeling when talking to them so they talk lightly and sensitively jesus are you for real

NONE you miss of the shot you do nt take experience absolutely help but it s mostly a matter of meeting someone you click with and if you do nt try you never will you said yourself some people put a lot of effort in it s not coincidental that they re the one who succeed yes they build experience but it s through their effort
AH this thread is a joke clearly there is no correlation between people watching professional sport and then playing said sport obviously program such a nfl play have no impact in the world yup i ll be damned if sport do nt just make the whole world a fatter place
NONE frankly it s because a larger portion of the audience is overweight if you make fun of something that will likely upset a lot of viewer you ll have a bad time on the other hand joking about a jockey s height doe nt upset anyone because it s part of his career and not many people are professional jockey

AH i guess we re done here then what do you want me to say lol sorry for pointing out that you were circle jerking and that you had to go and ruin and derail our debate it s not like i accused you of something without any proof i mean the proof is right there for everyone to see so if that violated rule then that s pretty stupid haha
NONE it is certainly heartless i d argue that pragmatic and heartless basically mean the same thing in this context however that doe nt make it a bad decision you do nt decide how you feel if you were bothered enough by his debt to break up with him then even if you tried to continue you would probably have started resenting him and it would have failed anyway just later
AH religion is not in the title if you ca nt read that is nt on me
NONE but you do nt disagree with the idea itself then just the timescale
AH nope still not even getting close to the core argument regarding public funding and subsidization done here cya
NONE i agree entirely moore s law is much too real and even regulation is nt going to be enough to create a tech barrier
AH i m sorry that you feel the need to lash out it sure doe nt sound like you re very happy lash out i guess the truth is lashing out for safe space needing tumblerinas who live in echo chamber found a representative video of your kind http wwwyoutubecomwatch vzipkdusnike
NONE all you can do is all you can do hated it when i first heard now i love it it s from art williams i love his just do it speech first few minute of this clip http wwwyoutubecomwatch vjjmjyeeng edit not trying to change your view just thought you might like this quote after giving it some thought
AH http iimgurcompuydagifv someone failed basic statistic and research method if not basic critical thinking the fact that one think is there a reason to assume that all transgender people are not like himher is a better or good enough counterargument against is that a reason to assume that all transgender people are like her how someone could have so much confidence for such a limited way of thinking is ridiculous sometimes
NONE no and this is where you are wrong if there are basic rule other than optimize outcome you are disregarding evidence it is like a religious fanatic saying i want the best life possible so long a we all follow the bible exactly it is just that you are plugging in basic human right instead of bible and while i agree that is actually the correct thing to do it is not an evidence based decision it is a philosophicalmoral decision
AH these people are idiot cps is the most useless fucking thing on the planet my girlfriend is an autism specialist at an elementary school in a bad area of town she report so many case to cps but they ca nt do a single thing she s documented with evidence cigarette burn bruise in the shape of a hand fractured rib missing chunk of hair from being pulled out and many other similar thing but a soon a the parent threaten to sue or make a fuss poof cps is fucking gone these kid cry every single day when it s time to go home because many of them do nt have food to eat at home and they know what awaits them once they get home it s fucking fucked
NONE which is okay since you ca nt be expected to personally understand what it s like to experience something you re incapable of experiencing however i do encourage you to see yourself on more the extreme end of a spectrum if we make group a black and white a those who can walk and those who ca nt then i suppose we necessarily must take the year old grandmother whose bone are so brittle and foot so riddled with arthritis that it cause her intense physical pain to walk more than step at a time and place her in the group of canwalk but it s not like the people in wheelchair who lost both their leg have any compelling reason to be really jealous of her her situation might even be worse in some way
AH what doe nt make sense is your complete inability to comprehend simple concept
NONE i appreciate it but you also need to add a short statement explaining your reasoning
AH firstly thanks for the downvote very adult secondly calm down white knight i know reading is hard but if it were a racial thing second generation japanese would still have dificulties marking difference in the lsound and the rsound deal with flied louse joke do you understand that those are not mutually exclusive also it s beside the question my statement wa that second generation doe nt have trouble pronouncing rl correct that s independent of being victim of racist joke it s also independent of race a they are still of asian descent
NONE i see what you mean and i do note that i screwed up with the comparison to the population it actually is not hard for a man to sexually assault another man a of male rape case are manonman what i m saying is the inherent problem is not in that woman are weaker it s that some men are sort of forced by gender role to be forceful and dominant be a man man up etc this sometimes translates into abusive relationship i m not well educated in this topic at the moment but i d be happy to further discus that at a later point

NONE force people there to do thing force people do thing like what harvest cotton oh wait i m not really a deep civil war buff but i think the resentment of sherman had more to do with his literal scorchedearth policy than his outsider status sherman s brutality is largely an overblown myth of southern apologist check out this link http peoplecohumsohiostateedugrimsleymythmythhtm what is so deviant about defending your state from an invading army the skewed moral code op wa referring to wa slavery i believe
AH no fuck you if you have nt so much a taken the initiative to google transgender then you do nt get an opinion or at the very least keep it to yourself this person is ignorant and worst of all he is willfully ignorant i never said he had to be personally affected by the issue you ll note that my last remark said somewhat learned on the issue i m not asking for much from people but i m asking for a little more than nothing so fuck you apologist of the uninformed and ignorant
NONE “ they avoided one another s face for fear of what they might see mirrored there each man thought one of the others is bound to say something soon some protest and then i ll murmur agreement not actually say anything i m not stupid a that but definitely murmur very firmly so that the others will be in no doubt that i thoroughly disapprove because at a time like this it behooves all decent men to nearly stand up and be almost heard no one said anything the coward thought each man ”

NONE yes if it s a magazine having letter to the editor section make much more sense since the author ca nt discus directly with the people commenting but even then comment section can be useful they can help some people get clarification on thing just because there might be name calling and other thing that do nt help a discussion doe nt mean there are nt good discussion on those sight a well you just have to do a little bit a digging to find them

NONE at the risk of sounding selfserving there s really no need to wait an op willing to admit when his or her view is changed actually encourages reply i would think
AH without any source whatsoever source thousand and thousand of easily googleable example of adult sacrificing life and limb in the protection of child extrapolating from that one can safely project that such instinct would also manifest in this farflung scifi scenario general agreement doe not imply objectivity your sophistry is noted but we are talking about ethic which are ethereal in their very nature so if nigh of a population agrees then that is a objective a ethic can ever get appeal to emotion instead of saying what is wrong with the idea i did nt realize i wa speaking to a sociopath who needed this explained very well augmenting all unborn child in this fashion would be considered a human right violation human right violation are bad bad thing are undesirable undesirable thing should be avoided
NONE the problem i see with moral relativity is that if nothing is absolute we can not condemn great act of evil like chairman mao committed in china there is an absolute common or shared morality this is how we make law we ca nt all agree but somehow we get to a common practice capitol punishment abortion and slavery being three example i could be persuaded that there is a system of morality that includes animal and make more sense i have just not heard that yet is there a moral reason to get along with your fellow citizen if so then there is a moral reason to not kill cat and dog if just to lessen conflict with your neighbor if we can make that reasoning then we can start to move the line to include other animal having common value and respecting the value of others help trade and thus help prevent war

NONE i ca nt say for sure it depends on how much you plan on interacting with them in the future for some people you have to understand that no argument will compel them those people have some other priority rather than having an open mind on a particular subject at that point you have to be forceful in saying you wo nt discus that topic because you do nt like how they handle it for sure that will mean in their mind that you ca nt defend your viewpoint and that can be annoying to live with but you ca nt change someone s mind who is not open to it

AH you re being an as and you know it you think you have plausible deniability because of the specific way you believe you ve carefully worded your asinine remark but your real intent at least partly is to demean and you know it that s not deserving of respect or of anyone s effort to respond to you since you re just baiting me grownup discourse the kind that comprises substantive discussion that might lead to greater understanding and commonality doe not consist of attempt to cut others down you will hopefully learn that someday
NONE i think you re framing this the wrong way it s not right to say that other viewpoint have nothing to teach you those people are still motivated by something and have a thought process that is at least somewhat alien to you but what is true is that some people s perspective may be more edifying than others and that you are a person with a limited amount of time and cognitive resource it s not that some people have nothing to say but that what they have to say simply is nt a worthwhile use of your attention considering your own psychological need and the possible alternative
AH a someone who s been working for homosexual right to give blood i really want to know all the fact what kind of deranged libtard do you have to be to work for a feelgood cause you do nt know the fact about beforehand oh wait you re european never mind

AH it s bigotry to care what their skin color is we both know when you re talking about european immigration you re talking about the brown one it s not bigotry to call out a religion that teach it follower that men are lustful creature incapable of controlling themselves so it is a woman s job to cover herself from head to toe so a not to tempt men into rapeinfidelitysexual assault so where are you when it come to calling out the rampant sexism and homophobia in christianity where s your soapbox when it come to white people with shitty religious belief there are muslim moderate a easily a there are christian moderate and you ca nt create moderate by forcing people to remain in their own echo chamber mixing of culture even extremely disparate one is a necessary force of global value change it s not about islam for you and you know it it s about islamic immigrant a la the brown one everyone watching this comment chain know damn well you re a racist shitbag i imagine plenty of people who have been discriminated against due to nothing more than the amount of melanin in their skin would probably take issue with your brown one comment a well given that most people have a good eye for irony and tongueincheek comment i doubt it
NONE a a person that used to love dark humour i think it is a character flaw to like it it trigger something in your brain because of how wrong and hurtful it is perhaps it is good way for racist that keep their mouth shut to find a way to let out their racist thought harmlessly sexist to laugh at sexist joke most healthy people do not look for this so in a way you can say it is a way to let out steam a lot of comedian take the side of the victim and question those that harm those a bad comedian will take the side of a perpetrator a no one ha empathy for them only will they take the side if it is to question how society view them and if perpetrator have no control over it no one in their right mind would take the side of the perpetrator for any other reason to attack people with these joke intentionally is toxic to people that say racist joke are not evidence of racism sexist joke are not evidence of racism they come up with the argument that it is propagating rape culture or sexist culture which may not be statistically true it is however emotionally true the people that are in the these situation that are trying to recover and knowing people that would joke about it like it is funny is sort of messed up on the other hand you can say these people are trying to let off steam from their daily life

AH i m personally against that whoopdedoo the vast majority of woman think they are entitled to men s financial support and feminist are doing nothing to challenge that feminism ha a horrible track record when it come to challenging women everything get blamed on men and all the change ha to come from men that s why feminism is a pointless waste of time feminism is incapable of challenging woman to be better feminism is incapable of criticizing woman she s also not alone it s a pretty common sentiment nowadays and that evolution largely come from feminism no it s not a common sentiment of people in a relationship believe men should pay the bill on a first date clearly you did nt even bother to look at the article i linked you to alternatively we can stop saying that to men i d prefer that honestly a great deal of feminist do too really you think so because i think you re delusional do you know what men who complain about woman s sense of entitlement to their money are called red pillers misogynists
NONE i think you re arguing for these period piece or at least thing like got that are inspired by reality and real event to leave out what wa a real part of their time viking society wa very progressive at least compared to what we think viking were like and even then it s really norse society not viking because viking wa a profession woman have vied for power and the role woman have played varied some century saw sodomy tolerated others saw it chastised we re talking the span of hundred of year the same go for woman and what they can legally do that s always been ongoing we have nt just discovered giving equal power to woman just that it s sticking now in a more egalitarian era the idea that gender had notion about the other gender or that masculinity should be challenged ha always been around even the idea that telling someone all men are weak is a call not necessarily for feminism but for men to be men again still pertains to what you re talking about

NONE why should an innocent person be okay with being racially profiled why should an innocent person have to be treated like a second class shopper when other innocent people have full right and if you are just looking closely at the black people doe nt that simply you going to not looking closely at people of other race thus making it easier to steal it seems like your idea might just be another well we only search black people and we find that when we search a person they happen to be black so obviously all the thief are black i hope you can see the flaw in that argument
AH and you just keep laying it on all bitterness and zero substance you must be truly miserable to be so hateful toward anyone who hold a different opinion

AH the medium is nt genderless it is male dominated especially the one making the decision it s not just about money it s about power to ignore this is to be incredibly naive i made the statement about the typical white male because reddit is dominated by white men i ll bet you re one who want to deny their privilege even to the extent of cry out a the oppressed white male and yes you are too stupid to realizeacknowledge that you are being manipulated to serve the richest of the rich partially by fighting with your peer who may be a different gender sex race whatever than you so you do nt realize who is actually oppressing you
NONE i view a lot of the xpride movement a a reaction to real or perceived oppression and denigration from outside group black and queer pride is a reaction in some case an overreaction to black being told they re inferior to white and queer being massively stereotyped it s just human nature that if you re told you re a piece of shit long enough you will start to feel like the people who are insulting you are actually your inferior i still think it s a bit silly in a vacuum but there are real legitimate historical reason why marginalized group reacted by emphasizing belief in their worth they did it to combat everyone telling them that they were worthless
AH i mean this just is nt true company like pfizer are the benefactor of ip law in the pharma business company like microsoft are the benefactor of ip law in the computing business this is just a factual disagreement and you re on the wrong side of it the idea that the cost would reduce only slightly is false they would reduce to the point where they have to out compete their smaller competitor which in absence of ip protection would be massive claritin would go down to cent a pill and that would be a good thing not a bad one and the idea that business can just ramp up cost after the small business is done is wrong guess what happens when they raise the price again another small business come in they have to keep the price low forever this is simply a socialist myth i m getting a feeling you just do nt like corporation or success for emotional reason
NONE ok so take it out of a constitutional standpoint is it right for a government to limit how high your idea which in this case would be a corporation can climb if you were the ceo of something you started with a great idea that ton of people want would it be right for the government to step in and say no you make too much sorry i d argue no a for making such a large overhaul a you suggest i d argue that your idea would nt work by trying to limit profit margin you re practically begging company to cook their book send money to account overseas moreso than they ve been caught doing in the past why do business in america if you re not allowed to make however much you can it is one of the best place on earth to have a business but one big reason is that we ve fostered an environment where they can prosper to the fullest the problem we re experiencing now is that they are prospering at the average person s expense but it wa nt always that way and if we can do thing like divorce corporate money from legislation for example that would go a long way to fix what your idea seems to want fixed all without fundamentally augmenting what we have which i argue is at it core not so bad
