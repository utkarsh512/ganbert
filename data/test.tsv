AH any man that actually go to sleep on the couch cause his wife said so need to talk to his wife about her immature teenaged method of dealing with emotion be a damn adult and deal with it what s next she get mad and go to her parent place for the night grow up
NONE a sober guy trying to get a drunk girl to say yes to having sex with him is an attempted rapist and if he go through with having sex with her then he is an actual rapist even if she say yes multiple time she s drunk he s sober enough to see she s drunk he s taking advantage of her it s rape
AH whatever blocking you because i know better than to waste time on the typical motherfucking windowlicking retard that post shit like hitler wa right get the fuck out of here this sub is for intelligent rational adult not racist manchildren
NONE i know nothing about the issue but on the subject of semantics i d say this im proud to be me regardless of who i am is the essence of it all instead of shame on you for being gay you say be proud of who you are it s all about promoting that mentality
AH if that wa your point you should have made it instead of expecting me to watch some barely relevant video and figure out why i m wrong i do nt think asking for a challenge to my view and not being willing to accept some lazy redditors favorite video with no explanation a a real argument make me an irrational person with no sense of logic
NONE i hear that but how do you think getting someone to come to term that there is no such thing a race which a lot of people confuse with colorblindness if we struggle to get them to understand what a dog whistle is the first is an enduring issueidea the second is simply a rhetorical trick we have nt even convinced them to read the book properly much le engage with the actual content
AH good luck with your recovery this is why i do nt really donate to charity but instead give to people directly i m afraid somebody like you might benefit
NONE i have had multiple vegan come up to me and try and get me to stop eating meat why is it not correct for me to say i dont tell you what to eat dont tell me
AH a wall would dissuade borderhoppers which account for of all illegal immigration rape but not very much wall can be tunneled climbed over people can be smuggled through border crossing flown over etc they are nt close to foolproof and in any case building thousand of mile of wall would cost far more than any conceivable benefit there are far better way to deal with illegal immigration cheaper better for the economy le purely symbolic talking about rape a though that is the main problem with illegal immigration make you sound a bit like a crank no offense
NONE jailing people is very expensive with no restriction on immigration there would be great financial benifit for nearby nation to deport criminal to the u instead of jail them even on the le extreme end with no control on immigration you either cant provide social security benifits a the poor and sick would again be shuffled into the u you can even see this happen occasionally inside the u with city busing homeless to other area state or you would have to limit them behind minimum year worked or some other determination of eligibility which creates an underclass which is very detrimental to society and ha long lasting harmful effect
AH if you base your vote on race or gender you re a fkn idiot
NONE did i change your view or just make a good point
AH i actually did link to several academic in another comment to my original response why do nt you attempt to debunk them so i can laugh at you
NONE when i first saw the headline i wa hoping you where going to try to convince u people should be allowed to grow cabbage on plane
AH of trump voter openly admitted they think black people are lazier than white people and i sourced it correlational data is useful do you have an alternative explanation for why people just happen to not rent to people with black profile picture and i m sorry you do nt read any social science research i guess your allergic to fact but i do nt know how you expect me to source all of it anyone who is even somewhat familiar with the study in the field would tell you they all show people are racist and have racial bias you call me willfully ignorant but you provide literally no proof for any argument you have the irony is overwhelming http wwwbenedelmanorgpublicationsairbnbguestdiscriminationpdf http wwwnprorgevidenceofracialgenderbiasesfoundinfacultymentoring http wwwslatecomarticleshealthandsciencescienceracialempathygappeopledontperceivepaininotherraceshtml http wwwthisamericanlifeorgradioarchivesepisodehouserules act play http wwwnytimescomupshotsurprisingnewevidenceshowsbiasinpoliceuseofforcebutnotinshootingshtml http wwwwashingtonpostcomopinionsclintonwasntwrongaboutthedeplorablesamongtrumpssupportersebeacaaeastoryhtml
NONE i mean nonbinary feel like they do nt belong to either gender they are suffering a well no you can feel like you re a unicorn or a dragon this is actually a thing it s called otherkin that doe nt mean those feeling need to be validated nonbinary people have a penis or a vagina they know what their sex is if they want to act in nonstereotypical way men wearing dress for example go crazy but do nt act melodramatic about it and do nt expect people to adhere to your sense of aesthetic yes our society is not particularly tolerant of in particular sissy boy or men who present a more feminine society is vastly more tolerant of tomboy ftm have it easier for this reason and nonbinary people mostly tomboy i ca nt agree with you saying non binary and genderfluid people are following a fashion trend this very much appears to be a social phenomenon most genderfluid people i have met both inperson and online have been ultraliberal young white woman transgender is completely different with a wide demographic spectrum i do nt understand why you would say someone advocating for you to be included it s insincere rich people do not care about the plight of poor people and intersectional feminism is a way to pretend to care
AH your takeaway from your reading is fundamentally ignorant to the utility of collar what natural resource are converted into usable material by it derivative are useful even under your particularly constraining requirement of directly demonstrating how they result in more natural resource being converted into product there is no debate to be had here any opposition to the concept is incorrect essentially all financial instrument to include derivative increase pricing efficiency or market liquidity which have a direct impact on the economy a a whole from the availability of capital an extremely important requirement for every single company to their operation derivative collar floor cap etc nothing helpful for society aside from extracting oil from the ground which is helpful for society but which is also not performed by derivative trader but by manual laborer and mechanical engineer this is incorrect an individual banker is far more responsible for the production of a barrel of oil than an individual engineer or an individual laborer and a derivative trader is contributing to oil extraction by increasing liquidity and efficiency pricing in the crude oil future market edit edited to conform to subreddit rule
NONE you are in that sense correct that in an economy at capacity government can usually not produce magic growth unlike an economy in recession where government can produce growth it can however influence the long term trajectory of growth by strengethening long term market confidence improving public health education produdcing a regulatory enviorment which is friendly to innovation protecting the economy from large volatility volatility is generally very costly for various reason or by increasing market effiency externality monopoly etc there are situation were government can easily produce massive frowth in recession and even if not in a recession government regulation can influence long term growth usually only quite slightly and in a long term there are even more way for a government to absolutly wreck an economy ofc in a pluralistic society it is rather hard for an individual to make a huge difference but i d argue that you are not correct let s take fdr and the new deal a an example where the presidency wa the main driver behind the programm so it is possible for an individual politician to make a signifcant difference in economic performance especially in time of crisis
AH the context of this thread and the content of my post should have made it quite clear what repercussion i wa talking about i explained in case your reading comprehension skill were low but i wo nt discus anything with you if you re going to deliberately misinterpret my post
NONE i m not sure what social service have to do with your writeup but the concept of hard work resulting in success go back much further in history than any welfare statesocial safety net program so you re just factually wrong about the root i do nt mean to be rude about it it just happens to predate those thing you list in the title
AH more moderate republican will defect to hillary than young bitter millennials who do nt vote anyway so no we do nt need you
NONE while we do nt and likely can not know why i think we can probably agree that it s not because they do nt care right
AH then go read it under the best of sub it s in every thread this ha been posted down in the comment hell even people here have given example or just read the bill everyone ha shit that is questionable i know finding out for yourself is a challenge and you d rather live in ignorance while believing your party doe nothing wrong
NONE ah to clarify the president s use of the gif and the gif itself are separate issue in my mind sorta like how the factory worker who assembles a gun is nt responsible for some maniac using it to kill people we can argue about whether it should have been made in the first place but i do nt think the person who made it wa doing anything wrong
AH it really is none of your business to get involved in other people matter until the well being of a person or their property is in jeopardy that being said if you insist upon projecting your moral opinion on and into everyone else s life then the nicest way to do it would be to approach the offender and give them an ultimatum eg i know you re having an affair and i am going to confront the offended about it i will give you week to come clean i would suggest doing this anonymously
NONE let me start by saying that i am challenging at least one aspect of your viewpoint in accordance with rule however minor after reading through some comment i ve decided that it should be both person s responsibility to inform the other but not equally so that is something to consider all the post that are trying to equate it to race or being the same thing a an infertile ci gendered person are completely missing the point and being dumb it s simply an issue that directly relates to sex i see it like someone with an std it s both your responsibility to ask and their responsibility to inform you both situation are awkward but it s more on them to let you know since they already know the situation and you do nt you are the ignorant one here they should inform you
AH ah here we go down the rabbit hole which encompasses all conspiracy theory it s where you go on to make assumption backed by nothing besides that since there something lower than you there must be something higher and that higher thing must be close by no thats not my line of reasoning but youre doing some really top notch condescending right now i can tell you spend a lot of time on the internet talking down to people in a desperate attempt to feel better about yourself absolutely great stuff one day you might make it a a professional bitter nerd then you go on to presume that if we do nt make these wild assumption we are all arrogant idiot fact is the only reason there something lower than u nearby is because we evolved well you know what i mean not literally them ofc from that lower stuff you dont think it arrogant to assume we can recognise the average intellient alien speciessociety a a whole
NONE okay i think i understand what you re getting at but from reading your other response i do think you might be colored a little by your own personal bad experience because i have never met people who have avoided exposure to people of different minority groupsbackgrounds simply because they are afraid that they might say something wrong and be called racist i m just not at all convinced that this is a wide spread phenomenon and even if it were it seems like it could more simply be solved by having someone tell them hey i know you have nt been around this group that much but they might ask you to check your privilege or something and you should take that a constructive not a condemnation like doe nt it seem easier to reach out and educate the few that might be experiencing this than to try and get everyone behind a massive relabeling experience just so that it might decrease a few people s worry
AH it s there to establish a forum that allows employee to interact with one another in such a way that is free of harassment intimidation bias and unlawful discrimination this may be at odds with scientific truth it actually scary how fucking clueless you are the whole point of this memo is hypocrisy individual holding literal bonified objective scientific data in their opinion are feeling intimidated or harrassed simply because fact do not always fall into line with feeling basically the code of ethic google hold creates the exact same environment they want to prevent this is evident because they fired him for merely stating fact you are literally promoting surpression
NONE the key fact it s based on is that of whether or not there exists a single objective truth and whether that matter your belief that child can choose for themselves is predicated on your belief that no single objective truth exists or that it doe nt matter if it exists and religious belief are just personal makebelieve when a person belief a single objective truth does exist they re likely to want to teach it to their child a a basic fact whether the fact they are teaching is there is a god and he love you and demand certain thing from you or the universe evolves by chance and there s no evidence to support a being in the sky giving order
AH are you deliberately being an idiot the whole point is that the legislature ca nt sidestep common carrier law are you deliberately being an idiot the whole point that for a half a century legislature and court did sidestep common carrier law with respect race so saying they ca nt ring hollow what indiana is attempting is to bring back jimcrow law except for homosexual so jim crow example are relevant the bathroom example is relevant because it show that separate but equal wa only found to be unconstitutional for protected group and homosexual are not such a group
NONE for example let say person x is at a protest and is saying that all white are racist i believe someone ha the legal right to punish you a small fine or something people should have the right to fine another person if they have been insulted and the statement ha not been a valid claim backed by evidence because that mean the intent of the claim wa purely malicious so is this just an expansion of slander and libel law this mean that only wealthy people are going to be able to use the fine system because a normal person wo nt be able to engage in a protracted legal battle for a small fine
AH now i m really kind of pissed because i do nt ever want to write up a long as post like that again just to have an op not even read it and respond with a shitty comment just to reassert your own view your attitude is wholly against the spirit of this subreddit fuck off
NONE i agree with op and my view is never going to be changed on this but i just kind of accept it a the way it is a a silly part of society that is so easy to conform to that it s not worth being an edgy hipster about and i think because it s such a small thing to do that people just go along with it a the status quo
AH so you want me to be forced to vote at gunpoint yeah how but you go fuck yourself buddy
NONE lol you shut them down harder then when i asked to popular kid to go to prom with me back in highschool
AH are you going to offer something else a a more suitable comparison or just be passive aggressive and condescending
NONE i think you are trying to compare something like chess and poker one is clearly defined and one tends to have a bit more variation
AH i have no clue what the fuck you think you changed
NONE i do nt see why you want your view changed
AH you literally wrote we still want to introduce kid to different subject at the basic level so they can decide if they want to persue them further and potentially follow that carreer path lol
NONE the point of those sign is nt to get people to eat everything they take but to get them to take le it make them think about how much food they re taking which they would nt do otherwise
AH it s rather pathetic that instead of addressing the substance and merit of my argument you brand me a racist and then summarily dismiss anything i put forth i told you before this is just a defense mechanism you employ to prevent critically thinking of your own point of view lest you have to challenge your illogical groupthink point of view i suggest that instead of engaging in your mindless groupthink labeling you take some time and reflect on the reality of the situation maybe you ll be able to come up with an original thought
NONE so your answer seems to be that you would argue with them and put forward your case for including asexual a a description of sexuality so then what if they rejected your argument and refused to accept that asexual is a description of sexuality the point here is that word and language evolve with common agreement and you are trying to stop the metaphorical tide from coming in when you try to uncreate new word or when you try to insert your own new word into an unwilling audience
AH can you fuck off with the misgendering comment her name is chelsea and you know that
NONE get the fuck out with that b logic this is rchangemyview not rcalltheothersidemorons
AH really gon na do this but but but what about the men shit edit by the way this whole thread is about how trump insult of everyone are a bad thing so no one is saying insult a man no matter like your stupid little persecution complex is screaming about
NONE i mean a guy just saying that on repeat would be a racist sure ok so do you know agree that truth is not automatic defense against the charge of racism your op said it s not racist if it s true i have been you an example where a you agree a true statement is racist
AH yeah what we do is totally on the same scale a publicly broadcasting burning people alive for their religious belief or posting video online of beheading gay my mind ha been so opened the us and other western government are exactly the same a isi i do nt usually result to this kind of thing especially in this sub but are you retarded unless you yourself are a legitimate terrorist you either have to be mentally handicapped or severely brainwashed to not understand that some state allowing execution by lethal injection for serial murderer is different than publicly executing people in barbaric way for a difference in opinion
NONE if someone truly hold a backwards and wrong view of the world which is scientifically inaccurate especially one a dangerous a antivaccination do you not think they should have every aspect of their view heard and rebutted think cmv but on a large scale should these thing probably be better structured with a pointcounterpoint timeline and perhaps even better done outside the public eye potentially but broadcasting company are in the business of making money and if the scientist ha an equal opportunity to set the story straight and publicly viewed it should hopefully change some mind
AH you need improve your reading comprehension skill i did nt say any of what you just said so you do nt have to reinterpret it for me
NONE how about saying god i want you or somesuch if they respond with i want you too i think pretty much anyone would count that a afirmative consent
AH look up circumfetishist nsfl also fuck off baby mutilator
NONE oh snap look like you walked right into that one umarkichi
AH dude he got you stop being a little bitch about it and move on
NONE i would nt do it either that much unrest would fuck up my civ game
AH vice writes article about tripping ball at the kentucky derby not really sure how them covering it mean shit doe cnn reporting on trump liking scoop of ice cream mean it will go down in history a important the college losing funding is not set in stone it a proposal your point about liberalism is just grandstanding at this point and irrelevant to the disucssion now if you would like to actually address the important part of the argument that social conservative are not for equality that would be great otherwise run along now and let u discus the issue at hand
NONE it s only an irrelevant topic of discussion once you have clarified that you have no interest in discussing it it wa completely relevant to the view before you had edited with those specification which is fine this is your show to run but when you make statement like if we are pushing for equal right feminism should nt this policy be changed also should nt feminist be advocating for this change a fiercely a they do with other inequality it s sort of silly imo to then act like you are nt interested in having a discussion about the point of view that a lot of those people interested in equality are actually trying to make
AH oh you do nt well i m crestfallen have a good day hero i wish you luck with your constitutional amending
NONE thank you for your perspective random person i do not care about it and i do not think i will engage with you good day
AH i m advocating the destruction of religion because it is ignorance that doe nt need to be there my evidence wa for christianity because you desperately wanted some and it an easy target already talked about culture to some other nerd check there i m not killing anyone fuckhead nor am i moving anyone nor am i forcing people to leave their family i am calling for greater education
NONE it is entirely possible that the poster of these thread have a logical opinion but have been put in a social situation where they have felt they are wrong eg if i am a parent who give my child privacy but none of my friend do i may feel i am doing something wrong either this subreddit will help me become right or reinforce my feeling that i am doing the right thing already
AH there is no gray to you and you think that it s the truth there are people who have a middle ground even if you do nt think it s possible it is and these people exist also if you want to talk about predictable you re a walking stereotype of evoking godwin s law when someone call you out on your bullshit
NONE i think you are right personally you send the invitation to person a not person b if you do nt want person b it is your party i will say party can be more fun with new people but it is always your call personally if someone s so is mad about going to a friend s party there are probably some more issue in their relationship
AH you said that right are universal you called copyright a universal right you were wrong so wind your neck in or get your delta out
NONE when you say selfishness for yourself what do you mean assume it s a simple a pushing a button and x number of pig will suffer
AH it s right wing propaganda it s a very real law proposal not sure what your point is here send me the proposal it s abusive in most circumstance to reinforce delusion if a woman belief she is a man and ha suffered her entire life because she never felt comfortable in her skin and then finally ha a sex change operation and ha her friend and her family use masculine pronoun to refer to him and he suddenly feel more comfortable with his life than he ever felt before then he is a man your fearful unsympathetic parochial backwards fundamentalist worldview would rob this man of being comfortable a a human being i know this will mean nothing to someone like you but your view is shameful
NONE hang on here s a hypothetical for you say you meet a beautiful woman she wa born a woman all that maybe she s your girlfriend now one day while considering to have child she ha a genetic test which reveals that she is phenotypically a male xy chromosome with androgren insensitivity syndrome do you break up with her i guess the question is at what point would the change have had to be made for you to accept her a a worthy woman reassigned at birth how about a a small child if you are ok with the above xy woman then it is nt a biological imperative but rather a feeling of being repelled by someone who lived the same experience a you know your secret so to speak
AH it s not the wrong sub it s the wrong site you absolutely can not submit view that can be challenged by most people if you re going to use rchangemyview do nt read anything that ha more than comment or anything with nonpc view the problem with reddit is voting system or specifically people using said system in cmv this manifest a incredibly poor argument that are being upvoted and op being harassed for not giving out a delta at worst you get downvoted so much you have commenting time limit overall if you re going to use this sub a your place to discus only use view that you would discus with a yearold honestly i ca nt believe a year old account ha posted a topic like this on cmv you ve derped a bit there mate
NONE i personally disagree with the ah decision to outright reject discussion on the basis of civility that s fine but it not your subreddit and you do nt manage the modqueue which lead directly to the second part it seems a point i m arguing repeatedly in this thread is that i m not convinced ah is overrun by people who are steadfast in their opinion have you considered confirmation bias that may very well be because the mod do an admiral job of deleting all the really bad stuff before you get a chance to see it those mod are really active and very strict about the high standard they set they could be removing dozen even hundred of such post a day and you would never know i do nt want to get too into the meta side of this from cmv s perspective because then we d be breaking rule d over here see the sidebar for our rule list but i will simply say that cmv doe not ban post on holocaust denial
AH if you declare something pseudoscience after one class then maybe education is nt meant for you
NONE i do nt think it deserves respect because it take barely any imagination or effort to create
AH by your logic all labor should be illegal dur
NONE you are correct there is no need to change your view
AH okay do nt come cry to me when isi steal your beer and cut up your girlfriend or daughter s pussy
NONE you rape her and ask did it feel something like this either way you have proof she wa raped
AH yes you have a disorder
NONE you ve got to be kidding
AH yea i m sure there wa a massive conspiracy where hundred of people worked together in perfect secrecy to rig all the electronic voting do nt be an idiot
NONE i would just like to add that any of the perceived deficit in the military can probably be corrected if we audited the pentagon there is a lot of waste
AH no no no holy shit people like you are the worst if i am yelling at you on the road it s because you are a fuckup you should be made to feel terrible and threatened otherwise your stupid as will never learn
NONE bravo sir bravo i know this will probably just get deleted wanted to come here and say that i feel the same way lying to child for any reason is just not good parenting the santa myth is really dumb
AH but she is nt minimally qualified your opinion is false and you are a fucking faggot nigger noob
NONE honestly this is usually how i treat most one person restroom anyways if the guy bathroom is being used
AH why op did nt limit his statement to sentient being and if he had then we d get to argue over what make something sentient my statement is exactly a valid a his that s kind of the whole point his dumbass statement ha no bearing on anything and is just an empty feelgood phrase
NONE someone else suggested that retard is a much harsher term than it s predecessor it s certainly harsher now whether it always wa or not i do nt know but that seems kind of beside the point your view is in regard to whether the word right now is offensive and ableist and it is
AH but you responded by nitpicking the example rather than actually responding to what you clearly understand is the point of it again i ask where do you draw the line what is to stop a new form of policymaking by siege if anyone who feel wronged can pick up a gun and take a building i did nt respond because it s an idiotic line of thought how do you see this becoming a legitimate way to advocatelobby for change there s just no way it will happen because most people are unwilling to do it you re in fantasy land by thinking that the national guard or fbi allowing this to happen will spur on a movement of armed citizen occupying government building i am saying they brought the gun for the purpose of making the police afraid they would shoot them and that is exactly the effect they have had that is making a threat again that is not making a threat you can sit there and say it is but that doe nt make it so i also do not think that s what they did they brought those gun to defend themselves from what they view a a threat i disagree with their line of thought but that doe not mean they took an action with the intent to threaten someone
NONE the delta giving is up to you if you feel i ve influenced your view by all mean it doe nt mean the discussion end and that the amendment specifically doe nt do a lot to protect me it s fine that they do nt do much to protect you but you are not the only one in america the example that is commonly brought up is people who live in rural area or people that live in any area that ha a poorinsufficient police presence really or during time of unrestriot when the authority are overwhelmed not to mention gun obviously have more us than self defense but i d agree that s a little beyond the scope of this discussion i guess it s more of a matter of whether you are a utilitarian or more libertarian the idea is that we give everyone a shot haha to defend themselves rather than deprive them of that chance for the greater good of course i disagree with that latter point a well i do nt think the removal of the second amendment would really help even if we could roll back some of the gun possession it s just picking winner and loser imo
AH no the word anecdote doe not rely on fucking context fictional real life event are not anecdote you are incorrect in everything you are stating if i mentioned that i knew someone who wa there and then based some objective claim off of something my friend saw that happened that d be an anecdote not mentioning the action but op asked for it and you attacked him instead of providing it i did not i asked them why european islamic attack were nt included and then demonstrated why they should be try and keep up child
NONE it s possible that he could be innocent however you only have one side of the story we are nt sure if other action or conversation where had that made it clear that dating wa not an option at the same time filing sexual harassment is very serious did they go overboard possibly could the substitute been doing other sexually suggestive thing that he did nt tell you about maybe if it were me i d naturally feel bad too but i d also temper my feeling because we just do nt really know the whole story
AH totally let s go get em with pitchfork amirite s you are a bigot straight to the core i suppose i should be happy you re offended at being called a bigot at least you seem to realize it s a bad thing that s progress at least
NONE imagine going into a doctor s office and being told that they overbooked and everyone showed up so your appointment is cancelled i do nt disagree with you it s wrong i do nt care if there are wasted seat that s the cost of business
AH ok firstly stop being an as it s not helping anybody i never asserted that electronic musician or mozart are nt musician or that use of a real instrument make you a musician that s just false like i said i see it a the ability to convey emotion through a musical idea or performance idea and delivery and for the last damn time i m just stating that mozart doe nt have recording people have just stated that he wa a good instrumentalist it s just a statement on his technicality i have no idea what energy mozart played with so how the hell am i supposed to judge him a for my ignorance please direct me to me where i can find mozart recording read what i posted before acting like a pompous as
NONE i would posit that there s probably some reason that she get offended easily whether or not it s logically sound i ca nt say but i would nt discount how people individual experience shape our worldview just because one jewish guy in class doe nt mind doe nt mean he speaks for all jewish people also i m guessing you re in college i once took a half lettergrade deduction from an assignment in a film class because i refused to listen to a certain song in a certain musical we were studying because it wa played to death during my retail job and i d grown to loathe it with a fiery passion it wa the song minute from rent for what it s worth this just to say that when we re in hscollege we take stand on really silly thing sometimes
AH your opinion just show little insight in international politics and how culture and society work switzerland is tiny culturally homogenous this is so hugely wrong switzerland is far more diverse than the u for a start switzerland ha national language have catholic protestant muslim and a bunch of other faith of their population is foreign born but hey what do fact have to do with this anyway what doe being landlocked matter three of the country with the lowest gun crime are island uk japan and australia they have taken the neutral stance for a long time and the military requirement thing only work because they have a small homogenous population and their culture allows their society to function rather smoothly again so hugely incorrect but still irrelevant this especially would not work for the usa where there is no unified culture so many different immigrant and class given disparity between people and the much freer society there is both a lot of people on top and a lot on the bottom creating strife i advise you leave the u when you get the chance and until then stop talking about shit you know nothing about on sheer size alone it would also not be possible to have such a program in most other country how doe scaling work
NONE i ca nt help but think you re bundling quality of life with national identify you re correct but i m not arguing for the case of nationalism i m arguing that national symbol can have significance that is genuinely useful canada s immigrant do come together under one banner so people from different part of the world adopt at least partly the new culture which is how so many immigrant from so many place get along together specifically i m trying to make a case against this further highlight physical and cultural difference keeping race creed and skin colour at the forefront of discrimination an immigrant s experience often brings people together which reduce the difference bw culture for example there s a lot of historical hostility bw japan and china but immigrant from these culture are often able to put these difference away and that s partly because they ve adopted a new culture it symbol tradition and law there s a lot of solid social science data that show that exposing people to different culture reduces xenophobia over time while isolation breed indifference edit one more thing leaving an environment in quest of a preferable one ha nothing to do with nationalism what happens after people move to a new country ha a lot to do with nationalism some country are very good at helping new immigrant dive into the country s culture canada excels at this and using symbolism to unite them for a common purpose cliched a that sound is very effective
AH if you re not a troll then you re a moron human are nt bear
NONE let me just say there is no view to be changed here you are correct
AH i addressed your argument i ll assume it suit you to keep whining a opposed to addressing it
NONE i partially agree with you but i m genuinely curious what the problem is with just referring to them a black
AH exactly op should spend some time in a european country with mass muslim immigration and see how safe he think a woman would be there that s you being racist i dont tend to listen to racist in what doe or doe nt constitute racism because they tend to have a distorted understanding of it but nice try i bet you believe in reverse racism or that talking about racism is racist or that black folk would nt get shot by police of they were just better behaved fuck off you neonazi shit
NONE i get that telling a group of jewish people a holocaust joke can and usually will offend them and that s okay i do nt get why people get so offended by rape joke what is it that you get about why a jewish person would be offended at a holocaust joke and whatever it is that you get why doe nt that thought process extend to rape victim hearing a rape joke a well seems like they are obviously similar a direct victim or indirect victim of a situation doe nt like hearing joke about the situation
AH what i said wa silly this kid is talking about one community for everything that is silly there will always be branch and that s exactly what you re saying and i m saying gtfo
NONE so you believe that every single person is born the exact same way and that we re basically just all created from scratch by our environment just to be clear that is what you re saying right
AH your wit were more useful what doe that even mean this is nt even worth responding to this is just stupid
NONE you literally just stated a fact so we can not change your view it would be like me posting cmv equal
AH that s all you care about blackface if you re going to pretend to be outraged why do you ignore the other version of race that the app would do got ta stick up for the defenseless black people because only they are important it s cool to laugh at everyone else your tumblr tier argument are pseudo intellectual nonsense and reek of actual racism you believe racism against black is more important of an issue or worse you might actually believe it is nt possible to racist to white
NONE you mean you did nt mean the most literal possible interpretation of your word like how people who say that being gay is nt natural do nt mean being gay doe nt occur in nature but rather that they thing homosexuality go against what god intended the natural order to be doe it seem fair to you to hold the opinion of others to a higher standard than your own opinion are held or is it possible that for the most part you are just giving an overly literal reading to an opinion you disagree with to make it at odds with the fact
AH look buddy whatever you re trying to do i will say this the manner in which you re speaking asking am i getting it right whatever come off a very very condescending you re making a huge effort with this tone and conversation and you clearly have some point you re trying to make so make it stop asking these frustrating leading question and coming off a a condescending prick while you re doing it
NONE eg no offense but you re too stupid to get this in the end it ha to rely on who s saying it not what s said over the internet from a stranger it s likely to be interpreted in the sarcastic sense if it s coming from a friend pulling you aside they may not even need to say no offense and might just say hey you re being a bit obnoxious out there or even hey easy on the gasoline they ll think you re a jerk
AH she s wealthy it s her fault she s been financially successful only poor people can represent trans issue do you not understand the exposure of trans issue would be much much smaller without jenner she supported trump so she ha to be solely identified by being trans she s not allowed to have idea and opinion that do nt have to do with trans issue she doe nt have a real job get wheeled around by the medium and make a mess of it what you seriously sound just super jealous of her position have you listened to her speak or anything she s completely aware of the amazing situation she ha been in relative to other trans people she ha no idea what every other trans person is going through so now you re completely disregarding her whole entire life struggle with this just because she s rich and doe nt have a real job anymore she doe nt understand the struggle and since when are only those who are struggling the most allowed to speak out for their cause are you actually under the impression that you ca nt stand up for people le fortunate than you overall you sound like a bitter jealous person who ha no real reason to hate caitlyn other than her being more successful or having an easier time than you she may not be perfect but she ha normalized trans issue more than anyone ever ha
NONE why do you believe that a woman s individual choice ca nt be evil or bad what if a woman decided to abort after genetic testing showed that her baby would have brown eye while she always wanted a baby with blue eye what if a woman decided to abort after the ultrasound showed that she wa going to have a daughter but she wanted a son what if this is her third abortion in her attempt to have a blondehaired blueeyed son maybe a a legal matter a woman can abort for whatever reason they want but that doe nt mean that the decision ca nt be evil or bad just because it is a better legal system to allow woman the choice to abort doe nt mean that every one of those decision will be the right one legal and illegal is not the same a good and bad down s syndrome is something that people generally agree is undesirable but is that merely a reflection of our cultural value if another culture belief that son are better than daughter that blue eye are better than brown eye and blonde hair is better than brown hair would that make those decision okay ca nt we imagine a better a culture where people with down s syndrome are valued a individual in the same way a others where the extra care they need is nt seen a a burden on their family but a a shared societal responsibility would nt there be more good in a society that loved all people equally regardless of disability
AH um yeah i do heck the fact that you keep pushing the economics thing after my rant indicates to me i probably know more than you
NONE honestly i agree with you op i think that the israeli should find another place but unfortunately neither side will ever back down
AH lol nice reply loser since apparently you ca nt fucking read i ll leave this here useful able to be used for a practical purpose or in several way use the act of using something the state of being used a way in which something is or can be used so yes i understand stress can be used for motivation that is not exclusive to stress there are many form of motivation that is a conscious choice to deal with stress in a positive way not an immediate natural reaction to it and ha nothing to do with my question i wa not asking how stress can be used positively or how to deal with stress or what is a positive reaction to stress i wa asking why it would be the most useful emotion
NONE if my friend is single is open to relationship then meet and get close to someone who match his own criterion get along with him well and share the same core value it is only natural for him to develop romantic feeling ditto for the girl i agree that it is completely natural for someone to develop feeling for another in this situation but i challenge that it will or should be expected to happen all the time or that one should expect reciprocated feeling what if one person despite all they have in common is just not physically attracted to the other or doe nt feel an emotional connection with the other i think there s a lot more to a romantic relationship than you describe here
AH just find a youtube video on how to clean a fish instead of wasting it life it s not like it s complicated a for how to cook one there are these thing called recipe that are a set of simple instruction on how to prepare food and guess what you can also find those online what a world we live in
NONE so the issue is are you torturing the fish more in a tank so that it would be better off dead i m not sure how one would get at the answer for that good question doe it matter if you keep a fish in a tank for a while a a transition to your next place which could have a more natural environment
AH if you choose to read that a complaining even tho i ve outright said i m quite content in my situation then there is clearly no point engaging with you further you clearly view anyone who is doing better than you a undeserving and ungrateful regardless of what they say or do so there is little i can do to change that bias since you ignore most of whats said you re demonstrably complaining k good k too little that s a complaint it doe nt have to be negative to be a complaint i do not clearly view anyone doing better a undeserving or ungrateful i think your complaint is literally the most bullshit thing i have ever heard good luck to you and i hope your situation improves it would probably help you greatly in the real world if you worked on your hostile attitude i ca nt imagine it brings you much success look faggot this is the internet i can reply to you how i really feel without the daily filter i have to apply to real world situation i m really really sick of people doing well telling me how i should feel about how little i make you do nt give a fuck and if you had the power spoiler you do to help you fucking would nt because you do nt
NONE i think it really hinge on whether or not you are involved when the two of them are having piv sex i think you re totally justified in saying piv is out whenever you re participating it s a turnoff for you and you ve already established it a a limit however if it s part of your relationship that the two of them sometimes have sex without you i do nt think you can really dictate what the two of them do together it seems like what you want is to stop feeling uncomfortable you already rationally think they should be able to do this it just still make you feel weird i think the solution is nt to fight that but to accept that it make you feel weird and that s okay so much of the time we feel like we have to fight any discomfort that s irrational because we do nt have a right to feel that discomfort but we do we have mixed feeling about so many thing in life and we do nt have to get rid of all our negative feeling it might be the best thing to say my wife and boyfriend have piv sex and that make me uncomfortable but that s okay i ve found that since having that attitude actually help make the discomfort normal the discomfort actually get to be le of an issue over time
AH sorry but you need to get over it you have an irrational fear that you re refusing to overcomenot a terminal illness people like you should absolutely not be allowed the option of assisted suicide you need to stop making excuse for yourself like a child and confront your problem being afraid to go outside should not be considered something to assist you killing yourself
NONE if you remove the people that are adamantly against you if you vilify your opposition you re not removing them they still exist and they can still try to sway the fence sitter if you want people to become firm supporter it help if you can ignite their passion and get them emotionally invested one way of doing this is to convince them that your opponent is either a bad guy or an idiot
AH dude what the fuck go back to france you liberal faggot
NONE respect others and do what the fuck you want
AH you mean according to the guy who i m not interested in your attempt to discredit the witness so no it doe nt sound like the professor is prescribing a point of view your trimming of the quote is intellectually dishonest and went on to talk about the ubiquitous cisgenders and the need to allow people define their own gender i have no further interest in discussing the matter with you because your reasoning is clearly and obviously fallacious i am disabling inbox notification for this comment good day
NONE i read through the conversation and i think that udeathpigeonx and upoppinj made a decent attempt at helping you understand the matter especially when they made the case for false identity it s an important point but let s get to your cmv rchangemyview is the only safe place on reddit to express any viewpoint and play devil s advocate i often lurk at rneutralpolitics great discussion a lot of user provide source for their argument there s a lot of great back and forth and it s almost always very respectful edit grammar
AH typical libtard reply yelling name calling arguing with emotion telling other people how they should feel about thing very telling enjoy the next episode of the view

AH the characteristic of many male in specie have evolved specifically because of female desire female desire is what drive development in evolution is it not equally if not more likely that woman evolved desire towards physical characteristic of successful men especially considering evolving desire is a lot easier than evolving physical characteristic you are asserting that men evolved square jaw to accommodate woman preconceived attraction to a hypothetical square jaw rather than square jawed men being better at survival due to the physical attribute of a square jaw and in turn woman evolving an attraction for them because those men are better provider due to their physical attribute frankly thats absolutely ridiculous you couldnt be more wrong zero point afforded to you and may god have mercy on your soul
NONE yet i have never heard of a study that support the assertion that male brain intrinsically have higher cognitive ability than female brain there doe nt need to be a higher cognitive ability in one gender or the other there just need to be a higher frequency of people with a diverse set of biological feature that give someone an advantage in stem men and woman can be just a smart a each other on average but different genetic predisposition to certain types of thinking can show up a different level of achievement in different area the classic one people point to is risk tolerance difference between gender these do exist and they would express themselves a prioritizing different career choice between the population i m not asserting men are smarter than woman but i am asserting that there is very likely a number of biological difference between men and woman which make men more likely to pursue and succeed in stem field

AH jesus christ you re a pompous twat and you re wrong would you look at that you re a dumbass in more than one way also it s spelt fallacy how ironic
NONE so you do nt think pornography produce a relatable reaction i mean fucking is one of the most universal stuff i can think of much more than dante s trip to hell is
AH i actually have worked in the legal field doing what being the tea lady would you accept a chance that your bank will someday run off with all your money i doubt it very much in that s a huge number for people who believe the person they have just married will stick around for life and not run off with the kid
NONE i agree with this how it s legal to say you will do x x and y and then get elected to the fking whitehousesenate and do whatever you want is so fundamentally broken even pawn shop have better policy it s a shameful time to be an american a a sick person in the u i am utterly terrified of what my future hold

AH which make it inherently more efficient than having many sometimes competing bureaucracy fucking lol are you serious government bureaucracy ha been shown time and time again to be le effective precisely due to the lack of competition
NONE but they really are not the private sector lack focus most of the time they are great at running with something and improving it but they are not good at making new breakthrough that requires a much more focused goal than the private sector can give
AH character is revealed by the choice you make you made a choice and it reveals enough about your character for me to never want to learn any more about you i m not the only one
NONE changing and moving on represents a very important part of who you are today it represents a new found strength of character you ca nt share that defining process with her because you do nt want to tell her how it came about that s a shame
AH the fact that you wrote an edit admitting that you changed your view without awarding a delta is chicken shit op you seem like you just do nt want to accept that racism could be covert while you hate making thing about race i certainly hate avoiding making thing about race when it s obviously a factor more
NONE the main part of your view that need changing is that you take this appropriating x culture thing seriously at all it s a ridiculous concept with no credibility if some group of people do something and someone else think it s cool they re perfectly allowed to emulate it in whatever way they see fit
AH i just find it a bit curious that a a black man the only time you post about race at all seem to be explaining why black people should be held at greater fault for problem in their community explaining way in which white people are nt racist after all making racist joke against black people it s a rather odd pattern just sayin i m not gon na harp on this further though proceed
NONE by this i mean i could be talking to someone about the issue of racism in our society and they may mention that black people can be racist too thereby derailing the conversation and ignoring the problem at hand it s a test they want to know if person s motif are a to end racial prejudice discrimination etc or b problack antiwhite no matter what so they re bringing up a situation which they feel will clarify that depending on how person responds
AH wait ar nt you the one complaining against behaving weasily i spent too many year a a writing tutor to try to parse this garble either be clear or do nt do nt engage others with your writing who is the subject of this sentence you that doe nt have any bearing on the person being offended is the subject other people ignoring thing that are offensive continuing to patronize the medium is kind of the opposite of self respect avoiding the medium all together because other people use language to bully is nt very selfrespectful either either your just throwing word out hoping they ll stick or your trying very hard to justify something to yourself but you ar nt debating or pursaiding write better writing like an ignoramus kind of prof my point see should nt you take offense after i ve called you a stupid bad writing racist
NONE i do nt think they re acting in good faith when they call it racist it s an old tactic of racist white to call medium that s critical of them antiwhite this is nt necessarily unique to racist whites those are just the racist i ve encountered most frequently and seen do this it s kind of a recruiting tactic i think you call one of them a nazi piece of shit so they hide their swastika tattoo run behind a random white person and whisper in their ear did you hear what that person called us just because we re white do nt try to follow the logic in search of consistency you wo nt find it because that s usually not the point there may be a few exception but i suspect they re rare they are stretching the word to the point of unusability but unlike you i think it s somewhat intentional the more muddied racist becomes the harder it becomes to identify them a such
AH is being a decent person that difficult for you i mean what about the idea is so complicated that you ca nt understand it
NONE i do nt think this is really cmv appropriate this is essentially a fact and there s nothing controversial about it
AH so what you re saying is that i should blindly follow the democratic party well i wo nt and furthermore fuck you do nt treat me like a child just because i look more than two year ahead if anything you the person whose argument somehow manages every time to mean we have to vote for the rightwardmarching warhawk neoliberal unionbusting technocratic democratic war machine are the selfdefeating one
NONE if i ve changed your view would you mind awarding me a delta instruction are on the sidebar a for your question i do nt think anyone should ever be disenfranchised however i m okay keeping the age restriction right now we disenfranchise criminal and a a result our criminal system is awful with the prison population we have it make me wonder how different thing might be if they had some say in leadership
AH i gave three source one of which had it own explicitly stated source in published literature the second one wa a random blog you edited your comment not chill not to mention you ve quoted two random blog and wikipedia you ca nt find one academic source at all and for something that s historical consensus that s a very bad sign all i m arguing is that you were wrong about that point you should nt have included it in your list you read some random discussion online somewhere and think you know more than you do now that you ve tried to argue the point you re finding it surprisingly more hollow than you realized before you made the point the fact is there is nt enough data out there to draw a conclusion that s what any real historian would tell you a lack of evidence is not proof that something did not happen at all when there are source to the contrary the jewish historical record but you re not an academic you really do nt know enough about what you re talking about and are really just trying to start stuff for absolutely no reason on a sub that s dedicated to reasonable discussion
NONE i thought that there wa a specific one that you were referring to would you think that there s any one or possibly a couple more thought experiment that are especially relevant to the question that i m posing i ve amended the link in my very first comment if you click it now it ll take you straight to the thought experiment portion of that wikipedia article that s the thought experiment that i m referring to i m sure there are a few others that could apply to your view but i m a philosophy noob and i think the knowledge argument is the one that work best wrt your cmv apart from that i can only offer my own subjective experience i ve used those online museum tour the one that offer a virtual tour they re good but i enjoyed it more when i actually went to the museum in person however i do know that i likely wo nt visit every place i want to before i die so i d love to go on many more virtual tour in the future that s one of my hope for the upcoming vr technology it ll be a limited experience but it ll be significantly better than nothing
AH i would not recommend engaging with this user they rarely offer any substantive point and will generally not address argumentscounter argument

AH this is not partisan politics it is not about support for donald trump let s see profanity check cap check sweeping generalization of literally all illegal immigrant a violent dangerous thug check do nt you dare insult my intelligence by lying that this is not partisan politics because short of the possibility that you are donald trump yourself you are a rabid conservative foaming at the mouth at the very suggestion that illegal immigrant or really any are so much a human being my kid ’ s safety is not partisan and the sooner people get that the sooner this country can get to healing all this “ he hate mexican because he want a border ” nonsense replace mexican with africanamerican and a wall with segregation and you ve flashed back around a half century to the argument ignorant racist like yourself were making back then and some still are and they were every bit a genuinely convinced that they had all the data and evidence on their side and that the race their bigotry and hatred were aimed at wa superior both in intelligence and manner to the one they were persecuting a you are nothing is new under the sun you can lie to others to yourself but i see through your nonsensical profanity laced all cap using racist rant you attempted to legitimize by invoking a think of the child fallacy and i know that you are indeed a racist and honestly people like you are the one who ought to be deported but then again i would nt want any other country to have to put up with your racist trash either
NONE but you see how your general approach is parroting status quo apologist right that many of the same people who would agree with you about how pride is too hostile to straight people and that gay should nt get special treatment are the one who would also take it for granted that any movement that adresses gay inequality count a special treatment in another post you mentioned racial relation which is an appropriate analogy just look at how you can have a slogan a extremely agreeable and innocuous a black life matter of course they do and racist will still freak the hell out about how it s too hostile and it should be all life matter or otherwise you are racist against white even if you are trying to talk about the ongoing problem of police brutality targeting black in particular apparently you just should nt talk about at at all black people should just behave regular people in the face of inequal treatment and somehow it will go away history show that inequality go away when people fight it not when people use misguided egalitarian logic to pretend that shining light on the concern of the opporessed is putting them on an unfair pedestral if i do nt see myself a being placed on equal ground a straight people how can society making yourself equal come before seeing yourself as equal ongoing inequality is not something that can go away from pretending it s something that ha to be fought and that will always rustle the jimmy of those who would rather just not conider the problem those people will always at first lash out with hate against any firm protest such a pride or the civil right movement and then eventually change their tune to how you are nt all that oppressed anymore so you should stop making it a big deal and please deal with the remaining lesser problem colorblindly without naming their victim because that would be reverse bigotry and special treatment

AH i should nt bother but i will just to correct your ignorance firstly what doe the byzantine empire have to do with the violence of islam also exceptionally violent the byzantine you speak of are the one that have sat on their anatolian region losing piece of land after piece of land to muslim ghazis since the fall of the western roman empire if they were exceptionally violent even though they were definitely not an exception their attempt at violence wa incredibly futile let s humour you and assume they were exceptionally violent doe that have anything to do with the violence of islam ad hominem do you really have to stoop that low to attempt to salvage your argument you made an incredibly stupid point you said that islam wa never violent and that christianity wa more violent than islam christian fighting between themselves are not christian dispute those are dispute between individual not backed by holy text the christian crusade amass to nothing comparing the islamic subjugation of the entire subcontinent of india and the ottoman invasion of hungary and austria we will not even delve into the previous islamic war of holy conquest on region of the balkan and anatolia or the fact that mohammed literally had to siege the city of mekkah away from kufrs so it s silly to say that islam is a violent religion it s not remotely backed up by history it is literally backed up by the quran s own retelling of history when mohammed violently took the city of mekkah from the kufrskaffirs
NONE think of how badly you despise the westboro baptist church while not all muslim will go commit act of terror it is true that a majority of muslim hold belief that make what the westboro baptist church say look benign of british muslim surveyed think that homosexuality is okay want there to be legal punishment for drawing the prophet muhammed of muslim in indonesia want adulterer stoned to death just read these poll http wwwpewforumorgtheworldsmuslimsreligionpoliticssocietybeliefsaboutsharia which by the way do nt include saudi arabia where they are even more conservative in their interpretation of the quran also you brought up the crusade those were fought in reaction to muslim spreading the religion by sword into europe before they were stopped at the battle of tour in ad the difference between christianity and islam is that christianity started a an underground movement during roman occupation and so could adapt to living under secular rule of law islam wa a religion spread by the sword and conquered vast swath of land quickly jesus never said go kill infidel there is a reason you do nt see a lot of violence committed in the name of buddhism because the teaching of buddhism do nt have any call to violence in them every other verse in the quran is about killing someone or how infidel are inferior or how muhammed banged one of his many wife when terrorist blow themselves up they do nt say i m doing this because of geopolitics no they say allah ackbar so of course islam play a role in promoting violence so while a majority of muslim wo nt commit act of terror it doe nt mean most of them do nt believe some thing very incompatible with western value
AH idiot do nt read what they link you do realize that it is not a fallacy but a valid debate tactic even used in mathematics embarrassing

NONE the hygiene hypothesis ha merit although it s still fairly hotly debated read more about it here http wwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc by people who have done a ridiculous amount of research on it a lot of said research pertains more to allergy instead of extra immune strength have you ever considered that perhaps your friend is a germaphobe because she s always catching something correlationcausation aside the biggest problem is that you re playing russian roulette with your health that piece of food you dropped on the floor might not have picked up any salmonella but that piece of food might and that person you shook hand with might not have the flu but that one might and the more you play russian roulette the more likely it is that you re going to lose disease is the last major predator of human and it come in a very vast spectrum of terrible even if you re better equipped than your friend against it that doe nt mean that something you pick off a doorknob and then rub onto your sandwich wo nt make you very sick or even kill you you would nt intentionally stab yourself with diseaseinfected needle lick a toilet seat or kiss someone who ha pneumonia why take that same risk in a different way i do nt think it s necessary to sanitize your shopping cart or attack your housecardesk with gallon of sanitizer or use purell every minute washing your hand before you eat and making sure your food is sanitary protects against the vast majority of disease

AH i am currently savoring the salty deliciousness of the trump voter feeling trumpgret because of what transpired this past year and a half including their tacit approval of trump s racism sexism xenophobia demagoguery etc because he would make america great again their tear bring me such a level of joy because they refuse to have a reasonable debate about topic and instead resort to name calling and aggression i savor their tear a if drinking a year old scotch next to a magnificent fireplace on top of a bear skin rug whilst periodically chuckling to myself at how easily duped they were by this conman all this said there s a slight twinge of guilt that i feel sort of like when i see a dog eating it own poop and getting sick after despite my best effort to stop this dog from eating it own poop if i m inherently a good person whose moral priority in life seek social and economic equality for all person born on this earth then i should feel some compassion or empathy for the trump voter who for example is now losing their healthcare covered under the aca or losing their federal job because trump is cutting discretionary program etc etc change my view i should feel bad but right now i do nt i myself have never met a person with trumpgrets but i can imagine feeling empathy for a lot of different kind of people who made decision and come to regret them however i think having the ability to empathize with someone on a issue ca nt involve you being a total prick and having a over inflated sense of superiority this isnt a personal attack this is relevant to your view perhaps you should re read your post and realize what a self important jack as you sound like feel a bit bad about that for awhile and then try and establish meaningful line of communication with those people you want to empathize with in short you cant express superiority and empathy at the same time and have it mean anything
NONE that s how you generalise if my own experience experience of my friend and experience of most men in society is not enough to generalise it i think we will never be entitled to generalise anything you ca nt really perform controlled experiment on something like this right but the problem come from turning this into a matter of law instead of having teacher who are regardless violating ethical guideline and often school district regulations given perhaps disproportionate punishment you leave those who have been truly taken advantage of and have been truly traumatized with little to no recourse i say this because it s incredibly hard to win a womanonman rape case when the victim is sexuallylegally an adult may i know your gender sexual orientation and age if not it s ok while this is normally part of adhominem territory i ll oblige this time because i think i can make an important point for reference i m a bisexual male twentysomething you re probably familiar with beer goggles the experience of being intoxicated and hitting on someone you would nt normally be interested in looking back at my high school experience and what few attractive teacher i ve had the retrospective experience is much the same a is true of almost every pubescent person my sex drive wa through the roof once it kicked in and i would probably have banged a tree if it could give consent with my current state of mind though i have a bit of a different outlook looking back the inherent power dynamic that yearold me would nt have even thought much about is now a huge turnoff a is knowing that this hypothetical downtofuck teacher is the kind of person that would eschew professional ethic and guideline in order to bang a person half their age with all of this said my perspective is certainly also colored by the fact that i m studying to be a teacher with a specific interest in child s right and classroom ethic

NONE i submit it is their work that is making them better people i also wish to posit that it is because they have a small tightly knit community of people who are nearly detatched from making change to anything not on that island yeah i think you re right a big part of the advantage of the small community is that you can see the effect of your work much more clearly than when one work in a large corporation for instance i wonder what would happen if you applied that logic to similar communuties and saw a similar improvement or general high level of empathy and etc etc think farm true small town and the like yeah i think that s huge and is something that is so often missing from many people work they do nt see the real effect of their work and it impact on others can i meta delta it is nt a full fledged delta but you ve made a change in my mind yes absolutely we do nt usually expect people to make change in their idea that s actually pretty rare
AH first of all to defend the idea of rape culture they use fabricated and misleading statistic they invent this strawman argument that supposedly male do nt seem to understand what consent is that never existed in the history of history they also use unrelated event and anecdote to push this rapeculture bullshit i know this for a fact and i m involved with a major university campus they flat out lie in order to get u all to believe their nonsense i see it on a daily basis a for video game have you ever heard of all art ever lot of hot naked bitties it a fact of life not patriarchy men like what they like and that will never change you clown the recent assault on idea is entirely a feminist problem talk to to any activist doing this shit and you ll find a neckbeard white knight feminist
NONE i did nt miss the disclaimer i just assumed that you d realize i wa talking about it in the sense that your post is the legal one not the moral one sorry if that wa nt clear it s late i tend to type fast my thought are that a child are not held fully accountable for their action and can easily be manipulated an coerced into doing thing that are harmful to themselves and others to say they have free will and need to take responsibility for their action is a massive misunderstanding of what childhood development is on a neurological level i ve worked with a lot of child they do a lot of stupid thing and if someone wa so inclined they could definitely convince them do to a lot of harmful thing to think that should be covered under free speech seems absurd to me do you agree

AH the original study make no mention of your social justice cult because you re a moron who s looking for sjw everywhere it s the entirety of social justice your sensitivity to injustice is linked to logic and reasoning not emotion like you people so clearly think it is but because you think so highly of yourself that you have everything all figured out and you do nt so much so you feel free to make accusation and assumption about me that s fine other people can see our thread and they re are aware that thing such a class race gender age orientation disability etc are privilege growing up poor or rich affect your life a lot money is a huge deciding factor in a person s life that is a privilege race is another gender is also another a rich white abled bodied year old man living in america is the most privileged person in the world he ha the most benefit helping him in life doe this mean he ca nt have a bad day or tough time no doe this mean he s a bad person or the enemy no doe it control the person s life no you simply do nt understand this concept at all and think we live in a fair and equal fairytale land that exists in a vacuum at this point you ve entered the point wherein i m starting to consider you a troll because no one i have debated with before ha been this dense to what is so easily googled and in front of their face but deny it so firmly a to act completely inane no it s not i disagree therefore troll it s you re acting like a yr old with similar reading comprehension and i m not sure how to handle a child debating such topic
NONE i would nt go so far a to call them le intelligent though they will struggle if they re not able to interact effectively with others while you re bothered by the comment the professor made about your friend it should be equally bothersome to hear the same comment applied to the kind of person you describe a a savant there is no such thing a a person who can experience the world without a fundamental flaw influencing some aspect of it some of u are horrible at math i failed basic algebra for example and more than year later i still ca nt grasp it but i can track a penny on a mortgage loan through ten year and three bankruptcy case and i m a damn good manager others do nt know how to deal with people some are emotionally stunted while others feel too much every one of u is le than perfect at something the thing is the world a a whole need people who are good at all sort of thing play to your strength is nt just a hippie mantra it s how the world function and intelligence should nt be measured by our weakness but by our strength using your example your hypothetical math genius is in fact a genius but so is your friend the polyglot their intelligence just show itself in different way wa your friend s professor wrong hell yes he deserves a good slap for saying that no teacher should ever deliberately insult a student particularly not with an opinion regarding intelligence which they have no way to measure but considering anyone le than others based on what their particular flaw may be is equally wrong
AH that doe nt magically make it ok what happened to red i m against any public shaming i ve literally read the book on it so you ve been publicly shamed and i ve experienced it this doe nt make what happened to red at mra hand any better the two event are nt some related tit for tat it wa asshole being asshole if you are fine with one and not the other instead of being disgusted at both then you are deeply troubled

NONE i do nt think they deserve respect in any way just for being dead but i do nt think disrespecting their corpse is appropriate or meaningful either
AH you are so condescending and dishonest in your argument it s actually incredible i looked through your post history and you seem to have a habit of doing that so take it from someone else you re definitely on to something and it very much look like an extremely pedantic argument created by asking leading question where you pretend to just not understand it come off a very condescending and dishonest i do nt really care what exactly you mean to be doing i m just letting you now exactly what it look like on the other side
NONE i know this probably is nt the advice you re looking for but this is nt a view we can change here on cmv this is something within yourself that you have to work past i once had an irrational fear of mirror it wa nt anything that convinced me but rather just the ability to slowly emotionally move past it i do nt know exactly what you feel so i ca nt really give specific advice perhaps you re being suppressed about it and need to work past an inhibition about discussionviewing it openly or perhaps the only thing that freak you out is that it freak you out if you ca nt solve it on your own and this is really important to you perhaps see a counselor who can help you more in detail in person and oneonone hope any of that help

NONE people often make sucide out a some kind of act of defiance against life but this is rarely actually the case most of the time people who commit suicide do nt want to die they just ca nt find the emotional strength to continue living the part where your chain of reasoning is wrong is when you say that you stop sympathising the moment they do the final act because in of the case the decision to end their life is not really a conscious choice sucidal people usually spend a long time fighing the urge to to kill themselves until they just ca nt resist anymore if that is nt pittyful then what is btw this is also why when you attempt to talk a person out of sucide you should not focus on convincing them that sucide is a bad idea trust me they know and it will only make them feel more guilty instead just try to build them up emotionally until they become strong enough that the rational part of their brain can get back in control
AH your argument do nt cut to the core of what either your or i are saying so i m just going to assume that you re not all that bright mind you the judge who sentenced brock turner ha since been removed from his position because society at large doe not think that rape is ok
NONE so to bring it back to protest if the system is rigged and that seems to be the thing we both agree on why would nt the protest be simply about if our side doe nt get the benefit of doubt then no one should they might not be totally correct because people should be innocent till guilty but i hope you can see why the protest might feel the way that they do

NONE i do nt mean to address you directly op i ve just seen a lot of negative talk online and so many people caring about it even though they have nt even had a sexual encounter with a trans person i agree that disclosure is important before you have sex or start a relationship but before this is should not be required
AH i m not sure you re using budget correctly there is plenty of money in the federal budget without changing total federal spending we could reallocate spending to easily cover medical expense without cutting any necessary expenditure i m pretty sure that you have a somewhat loose grasp of the terminology you are using and that s creating some communication problem can you try to explicitly rephrase your view without using any term you are nt super comfortable with
NONE what that ha nothing to do with my post my thought is just take step to minimize the chance that they will need to rely on taxpayer to afford expensive treatment to extend their life and quality of it indefinitely my thought is just that people like you will have a netdetriment on the economy and will cost taxpayer more in lost productivity revenue and fund for your sterilization program given that would you be okay with being sterilized why or why not
AH what level of advanced stupidityhypocrisy have you reached exactly you argue that people should nt have ability they are nt born with over a global network of machine that would have been pseudo magic half a dozen generation ago i m pretty sure you enjoy various form of faster than animal transportation and have an immune system conditioned by modern vaccine a well go live in a luddite colony somewhere if change scare you

NONE these apply to modern pride it s about exposure not everyone know out lgbts in their life showing our face humanizes the movement some of the criticism against equality measure is that we re only a small group and thus our interest are not that important by being out there in big number we make ourselves more visible it s about showing our feeling of selfrespect and worth that we do nt need to hide who we are that we are sick of oppression against our community desensitization to ensure people get more used to seeing u eg samesex couple holding handskissing men and woman who lookact in nontraditional way people whose gender is not immediately clear pride offer a fun and safe environment to do this

AH you literally skipped over my second point on thing college ca nt do i spelt it out below to help with your reading comprehension and point systems
NONE i do nt think i m hitting your argument straight on the head but i think this video is relevant and speaks to at least a few of your point http wwwyoutubecomwatch vekaiykg
AH a you seem to have no desire to engage this what i meant is that for every bill gate there s the unemployed aspie living in his parent basement at who s reaaaaaaly into th century sailing ship the term in the hugbox at raspergers is special interest that ignores of course the issue which you have nt addressed what about a lowfunctioning child one who s nonverbal for example and completely dependent on outside caretaker manipulation for the last time no dna wa modified in that movie they screened the embryo and picked the one they wanted and binned the rest likely they took a sample and amplified it via pcr looked at the gene they wanted using fluorescent marker and used that do discern the fittest embryo
NONE i agree and a problem is that what s popular ha no causative correlation to what s rational or reasonable a an example go to rconspiracy and offer argument against truthers instant downvote oblivion it s not rational just the predictable consequence the same is true at different time of the day on different day and at different time of the year my own observation ha convinced me that how many people are in school at the time is a huge factor in most sub at the sub level how you fare ha more to do with how closely you hew to the prevailing mindset of the majority of active participant and mod in that sub for reddit a a whole i think there s much le commonality except a i suggest above which is likely most strongly linked to age
AH mmm no rubiks made a few point you typed out some nonsense
NONE alright i think my other comment address this pretty well
AH wow way to be an asshole there is a huge difference between and and you re inability to understand that make any argument you make disingenuous is a couple of meal no one is going to do anyone any favor over x multiple bank is a significant amount of funding that clinton would pay attention to it wa the prebribe then after she wa president she d be invited to more talk and be given another round of funding by wall street if you do nt think politician are impacted at all by lobbying or campaign donation i do nt know what to say about your naivete and this is money directly into her pocket from those same corporation if it s so insignificant and innocent why did foreign government stop donating to the clinton foundation after clinton lost the election i have absolutely no problem with her raking in those speaking fee if she had nt been planning to run for office again but everyone knew she wa running after obama s year were up
NONE okay well aside from the fact that there s nothing in the constitution that allows the government to do that and you d essentially be turning the u into a fascist state it still doe nt invalidate my argument you admitted it wa unsustainable you d get a few billion at once to fill the government s coffer that would soon be spent and then you d pretty much be putting an end to philanthropy what if bill gate wa born a generation from now if he never became a billionaire he never would have started the gate foundation i m all for leveling the playing field but just stopping other people from being rich by itself doe nt help poor people i think up to say a tax on billionaire would be great then people would still have an impetus to keep making money and generating wealth and we d have a ton of tax revenue to devote to social program but when you cap it at you re just preventing wealth from being made and that doe nt help anyone if there s even a chance that wealth would go to a charity or philanthropic cause that s better than it never being made in the first place
AH are you arguing for a flat tax now they have been disastrous everywhere they ve been implemented get out of your libertarian fantasyland man and grow up

AH most movie are unoriginal nowadays not an excuse for a film people have waited year for and disney poured hundred of million into but there is a difference between unoriginal and every bit of story and plot point having been done in the previous movie a big difference rd s presence is related to the plot not at all anything or anyone could have finished the map your point here is rather contradictory because the biggest toy sale anecdotaly speaking are mostly related to bb a new character you do nt appear to know what the world contradictory mean because that info contradicts nothing putting in old stuff to sell toy doe nothing to contradict new stuff selling toy i think you are treating cliffhanger and mystery a plotholes is english your second language i ask because you are misusing every big word you write i did nt write about cliffhanger at all and just because something is nt explained or detailed doe nt make it a mystery i done reading your post since you ca nt even use word properly
NONE people like pewdiepie markiplier jackscepticeye all people that i do nt watch probably do deserve to have some of their video come under fair use i m talking about the heavily edited oneoff one that often have a lot of visual and audio effect i d still have to look at them on a casebycase basis but i m comfortable making a blanket statement that i think it would be ethically wrong for a company to take down most of those video i disagree that anyone should draw the line here regardless of whether let s play in general should be fair use which i m really not sure of personally editing in some stuff into a let s play is nt that much better than just doing barebone one it may take more work but i really do nt see why the line should nt be drawn based on how much work it took to use another personcompany s work for your own profit just like we should nt factor in how much work it took to commit any other crime and while it is adding more than just a personality it s still entirely reliant on the content of the game which the let s player presumably had no hand in creating
AH hahaha i m actually laughing out loud now seriously now the number are fake lol you see this is why i m smarter than you because rather than admit to actual fact you distort reality to fit your narrow narrative this is why you need to go back to your light beer and reality tv show truth is just something you mold for your own gain oh my god you guy are ridiculous ok tell me how obama made these number up please do this is really hilarious show me actual number and not something you just pulled out of nowhere show me how obama made these number up let s see all of your reference and statistic that s just a first of all second of all i do nt think obama created all the job you trump chump think the president creates every job under the sun the fed boosted the economy with zirp and qe x this boosted the job market obama created the infrastructure program which i might add is exactly what trump want to do except now trump is hero and obama is the devil for doing the same exact thing http imgflipcomiittip odozooogvmqwv
NONE i m not sure the medium doe much more than circlejerk named after the worst offender we have the john oliver effect you have your idea what they are do nt really matter because you know you re right right right what the john oliver effect doe is you will take a medium source and assign it value based on how closely it alligns with you preconceived idea of how thing are do nt like trump this is both comedy gold and gospel do you support refugee that little wheelchair girl is exactly representative of all the people flooding europe believe in a wage gap those republican know fuck all about woman and their choice the bias you and i and everyone else ha is so deep by the time we re even that we know the truth and anyone who disagrees is a racist idiot same thing with brietbart same thing with huffington post same thing with cnn and fox news and msnbc same thing with gamergate same thing with the subreddits we frequent i think the worst of it is how trump said he would strengthen libel and slander law to keep medium source from knowingly printing lie turned into trump fight against free speech
AH it s not clear what exactly you are arguing for here are you saying that people should not ask others to be considerate of their emotional reaction to certain trigger presumably either by refraining from doing certain thing or giving a warning that certain thing are contained in literaturemovies etc or are you saying that people are not really triggered into emotional reaction by external event or are you saying that they are triggered but that they should shut up and get over it like your superior self did and by the way i do nt think you have got over it
NONE so what exactly are the harms to culture that occur you must understand if you read the statement you ve made from the perspective that turks and muslim are people with exactly equivalent value to any other human like german and scandinavian then thing like seeing them outside and having them in your school are not actually harm so maybe you could clarify the concrete negative effect to culture in particular since you mention it that would not occur if these individual were german instead of say turkish
AH i m not feeling any bruise yea you re the guy that get the shit beaten out of him in fight and go around the next day telling everyone you won it s sad and embarrassing

NONE cmon bro be a true commie and give me the delta for the labor rather than the outcome i ca nt change you view if you we reach a deadend i at least changed you from being sure on your view
AH aaaaand do nt be an as especially do nt be an immature as you completely missed the point maybe you re just not skilled at expressing yourself clearly if you were nt distracted by trying so hard to look smart maybe you d be better at that i wasnt directly challenging those scientific finding but trying to illucidate the limitation of scientific inquiry prove to everyone how smart i am with some smartsounding pedantic bullshit that deliberately miss the point ironically enough scientist pretty much know what they re doing since you ve taken it upon yourself to criticise them you were challenged to present your bona fides qualifying you to do so you did not which i m forced to conclude mean that most of your relevant education come from the university of my as located in my mom s basement if your point is that the fossil record doe nt come with certified deposition date recorded alongside specimen i can assure you that few people who have completed a high school education without cheating need to be told that a full explanation of how paleontologist derive date of specimen or deposition is obviously considerably complicated which is one reason it take more than the length of a reddit comment to qualify a an expert in that or anything else the language i used is widely accepted shorthand for all that commonly used by educated grownups talking to each other about such subject and again few high school graduate need to have that explained ps illucidate is not a word and do nt blame your phone that s just pathetic
NONE i ll try and speak to one aspect of your response i would do these thing now if i felt i could form a well rounded opinion by the time the election come around the quiz i suggested take about an hour top if you re going at a reasonable pace what doe wellrounded mean for you that you know all the intricacy of every single policy ever that s a really highstandard and i do nt blame anyone for not wanting to do all that research so no one doe but what they do do hehe is support the candidate who most agrees with their current opinion of the issue because those candidate are or are surrounded by people that are expert and we trust them to represent our current view so what do you really define a being wellrounded further on it look like you define it a thus the information by that time would have conglomerated so that i can easily ingest what each candidate actually stood for and where i stand in regard to their opinion again site like isidewithcom easily conglomerate all of these people s view on various issue in one quiz what they actually stand for based on their prior voting record and show how much you agree with them by a percentage and break down what issue you agree with and disagree with so already that information you had above is easily available now and time from here until after the election wo nt change the accessibility or stance of that information so there already is enough information that is easily available enough to make a wellrounded and wellinformed opinion
AH you should be embarrassed by your attempt to use article and then when you get called out on it brought up the first amendment and cried about the medium
NONE correct and of course if you do witness an event first hand then you can indeed be the news and then analyze and opine on it if you so desire

NONE the whole cultural appropriation deal is not good for anyone it s people complaining because other people like some thing nobody win anything it s just a pointless source of butthurt
AH you re still conveniently missing the part where the electoral college elected the candidate that million le american wanted for president man your reality must be so nice if you can just ignore unpleasent fact
NONE well under that theory there is a reason to go out and vote for local office and since you re already there you may a well fill out a vote for president since it technically count and that is a small reason
AH this argument is really set up to be unarguable it s like saying if i get mugged late at night that person is a bad person yeah no shit but baby exist and they re around and sometimes it take more than a couple year for some people to realize how hugely their life have changed now that they have a child what about when you re eating a restaurant and your baby start cry is that person is also an asshole for interrupting someone s peaceful meal or what if you re sitting at the bank and a baby is cry the whole time these are not identical example to bringing a baby to a movie because a movie is pure entertainment and a not a baby nor parent need to be there for any good reason different from the bank or a restaurant and like i said in this world we re all just kid making kid no one ha a baby then wake up a mature experienced parent it might take a couple brief instance to really make the transformation into a socially aware parent calling someone an asshole because of a mistake that probably wo nt happen again doe not make them an asshole but if you re really trying to force this worthless attempt of an argument that really no one would disagree with then let me offer the following everyone in the world is perceived a an asshole by someone else at some point in time for some more than others and some more agreeable than others maybe i m seeing the right movie at the right time because i have no memory of a disturbance so great at any visit in a movie theater that it detracted from my enjoyment of the movie bringing attention to these assholes you speak of are people we all know have existed in the past but when we really think about it how often doe this happen have you confronted any of these people on why they bring a baby to the movie can any of these people speak for themselves obviously i ca nt justify an unknown group of people s reason but i can offer this a a rebuttal maybe you re an asshole too
NONE honestly this cmv is nt about heroin you lay out like different view that are all tangled up it read much more like a proeugenics rant than a discussion starter so with that said let s ignore the body of your post and just focus on the question let s first agree on something being addicted to heroin in and of itself is one single problem if someone raised their child lovingly performed the duty of their job exceptionally wa emotionally and intellectually available to their loved one wa a caring member of society perfect in every way but they had an opiate addiction doe that make them deserving of death if it doe then i think the issue is that you associate heroin use with basically being evil and probably need to reevaluate that so now that we ve established that being an addict itself is not a problem for anyone but the addict unless the addiction cause them to do additional harmful thing so let s talk about the heroin addict that you re probably thinking of the aid junkie who s slumped over under a bridge who earns income from sucking butt hole spreading their disease in the process and stabbing people at atm s they ve already sold all their possession and lost all family ok first i ll agree that this person probably deserves to die or if you are nt a proponent of capital punishment they at the very least do not deserve freedom and the same right a everyone else so we have the addict who is still a huge net positive to society and the drain both of these guy should be killed in your mind i ca nt change your view because at it s core seems to be tied into a very proeugenics and prointellectualism ideology which there are plenty of cmv s on in fact i d suggest if you really want to change your view that you just search eugenics in this subreddit i m sure it s been talked about different time yours is

NONE i wa nt really agreeing with you i wa pointing out that your argument extended to a lot more people than you were saying i will say that you seem to be a little cavalier in assuming that a person who want to kill themselves is of sound mind in the law and by common sense a suicidal person is at least presumptively if not definitively mentally ill inasmuch a a mental state is causing them to want to harm themselves especially in the case of people who are nt likely to die very soon it seems like i would have a pretty strong presumption that they are not of sound mind if they say they want to kill themselves

NONE i ll take a stab at changing your view suppose that these gay and lesbian people behave exactly how you re afraid they will or worse they drunkenly make out in public and hit on your straight guest who do you think that will reflect poorly on you or them it would nt reflect poorly on you if your straight uncle got drunk and made a fool of himself it would only reflect poorly on him in my opinion anyway second you said that some of these gaylesbian people are your friend and family member is it worth upsetting them and potentially ruining your relationship with them just to keep their partner from coming to your celebration you re getting married you ll probably have an awesome time dancing with your wife eating cake and hanging out with your friend and family i doubt that you ve ever been to another wedding that wa ruined by gay or lesbian you ll be too busy to pay attention to what they re doing anyway also last question what doe your fiancee think about this you said they re her family member do you want to start a fight with her by not treating them well

AH no it is your responsibility to back up the shit you say it is nt my responsibility to find quote you handwavingly allude to if you ca nt do that then you really need to admit that you ca nt doing anything else actually is intellectually dishonest so you do nt just get to say that guy over there said this http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsqgyjcmvitsintellectuallydishonesttoblamethe and then not provide the link to where a person fucking said that if you ca nt show that someone somewhere actually used the argument you re railing against then your entire point is a fucking straw man

NONE anyone can begin a post by proclaiming they are an expert in the field anyone can but obviously most do nt just the one speaking honestly and a handful of people bizarrely trying to pull the wool over people s eye and a i m sure you re wellaware reddit a a whole absolutely relishes opportunity to dig through a user s history pick apart and crossreference their analysis and in general go for an opportunity to out them a a fraud making these people fairly rare and rarely successful for long those that do are perhaps making an appeal to authority but really it s the soundness of what they follow here that really defines their authority again most can tell when someone s blowing smoke up their as no matter how they label themselves most of the time i think the here preface provides context for why they know what they know for example take this explanation of the change between a fansubmitted lego set and the onshelves end product http npredditcomrlegocommentswqexosuitsidebysideoriginalsubmissionvscippq context without the context of i m one of the people who worked on the translation the comment might be read a conjecture not an honest and factual explanation after all comment on reddit are devoid of intonation it s hard to tell when someone s being sincere or trying to help or know what they re talking about without that context being explicitly provided that s all i see the here preface doing providing context that help user understand where they re coming from and what perspective they view thing from that context can be absolutely crucial

AH hmmm funny how i read through the thread and no one else felt the need to go into great detail of the scene itself and instead stayed on topic with the question i specifically said i had not yet seen the most recent episode and they completely spelled out a spoiler even the metaphorical indication of it specifically after i said i had nt seen it so fuck off people know what to do when someone say they have nt seen an episode and it s not to give out detailed spoiler for christ sake
NONE i actually do nt know what the latest drama about the nsa is at some point i just resigned myself to the fact that some intern is probably reading all my fascinating secret correspondence and just stopped following it but from when i wa following it this wa the story i remember http enmwikipediaorgwikinsawarrantlesssurveillance – doe this inspire faith in the system for you remember this is what it look like when they get caught and we find out that they might be doing something illegal
AH since he wa unable to speak during the event there wa no way for consent to be given he willingly and explicitly placed himself in this position this would have never happened if he had not set several thing in motion like getting a venue ect the element of consent or lack thereof wa introduced by him you re horribly horribly wrong
NONE a president would never personally handle that situation if it came up the secret service would if someone were to aggressively approach the president they d never make it there therefore his handling of this particular situation ha no bearing on how he would be a a president he did the right thing which wa stand aside and let the situation play out his only other alternative wa to be equally aggressive which would nt show strength but rather foolishness
AH only someone ignorant of all the struggle that went into emancipation would give lincoln that kind of credit so no i think you would be hard pressed to find a race activist who would give that revered of a title to lincoln yeah like historian pshaw what do they know next to you am i right no i would be wrong about that he ha that title for good reason no one think he did it alone but he did kinda have the lead and got shot for it too i thought that meant something to you this idea is so hilarious yes freeing slave would make him a dictator even if such a ridiculous statement made any sense he could have freed his own slave no oh wait he had that power but did nt exercise it yeah fuck him to have enacted law that would have freed the slave and given everyone a right to vote just after the state agreed on something else yeah it kinda would did he free his slave washington wa the only southern slaveholding founding father among the top seven to emancipate his slave after the american revolution http enwikipediaorgwikigeorgewashingtonandslavery posthumousemancipation nice try though he wa an activist for civil right at the time he did nt actually have power over policy and if you ll recall he wa killed for pushing people with power to make those change activist do nt have the kind of power that policy maker do he had absolute power over the word he said never once wa one mentioned of feminism or gay right get rid of him too hunh so it s tote cool you have no idea what you are talking about but do nt talk to me about it anymore
NONE i m white so i ca nt really speak directly on that issue but here s something that made the concept click for me i m gay and at some point i made a gay joke to a straight person i think i said something he did looked flamboyant or gay or something and he got offended because he took it a an insult which show that he did nt get the joke he then asked me if he had said the exact same joke if i would be okay with that i said no then it s not okay because he s not gay which he still take issue with when i made the joke i wa making fun of the stereotype that that behavior made someone gay if he had made the joke he would have been reinforcing the stereotype that that behavior make someone gay i wa making fun of my own experience he would have been making fun of someone else s experience which he ha no right to do and i can apply that concept to the n word i have nt experienced what poc have experienced i do nt and ca nt understand the cultural significance of that word so i have no right to use it it would be like a straight person making a gay joke it s the same reason my friend and i argue about which of u look most like a twink but if a straight person called any of u a twink we d be fucking pissed it s the same reason if i heard a straight person refer to someone a a snapback lesbian i d immediately assume they re being ignorant at best and insulting at worst because they ca nt possibly know all of the connotation that word carry it s the same reason i have a group of friend who go by the fresh white egg but if a poc referred to u a that it would probably carry a negative connotation
AH what this doe indicate is that tristan think there is something peculiar about the person interviewing him that make it appropriate or acceptable to kiss her she s attractive and he thought it would be funny why are you engaging in dramatic conjecture for absolutely no reason and probably because men often feel like they are allowed or have some legitimate basis for touching woman do you really live your life like this just choosing whatever you think and then presenting it a probably true or likely how on earth can you in good conscious make such ridiculously unrpoven claim and present them a fact you should be ashamed of yourself your reply truly disgust me no fact your opinion presented a fact it is patently ridiculous that you are pretending to understand his internal motivation i mean seriously read usososkitso s comment and get some perspective
NONE doe it similarly make sense for a person to be willing to die for a cause they believe in that s essentially what assimilation is in addition do you think you have nothing to offer a an individual are you so worthless a a person a to be worth more in part than a a whole person i ca nt really understand why a person who feel this way bother to keep living at all all i am is my individuality that which make me express myself differently from other people that s what i ve got to offer in the world an additional sounding board that might give a different answer if asked a question from the guy next to me i find it hard to believe that assimilation keep those difference to utilize it really make more sense that it would meld idea and do away with the thing that wo nt merge there is then no back and forth and it would be rather difficult to build idea and culture from only one real source
AH op s comment in a post about israel and palestine hopefully ebola will reach that part of the world soon you two nation are just a damn headache for the entire world why do we have to see and care about all your bullshit just fucking kill yourselves and go to your heaven now instead of wasting our time i m surprised he doe nt post to stormfront
NONE you already noted a few reason for it in your cmv but that hour a week is necessary to be productive the other say you skip a night because you just do nt want to sleep and then a project you have to do end up riddled with error because you could nt focus now you just wasted all of that time only to go to sleep find the error and correct them
AH it must be really hard going through life being this miserable at least you wont breed thank fuck for that marriage ha plenty of benefit the legal part is important for a million reason a you must already know the most important for me being that you get to visit them in hospital you wont if you re not family second i want u to be a family that s why it s called a family name it show those people are a family a really close intimate unity also i want to be married in a church and have my marriage blessed by god this is by far the biggest reason i know people these day just give up when thing get hard but for me making a promise in front of god isnt something you go back on because he leaf his sock around the house and you dont like it marriage is walking the walk and not just talking the talk it s commitment you also think twice before breaking updivorcing which is a great thing since millenials give up on thing because they think they can get better
NONE i wa thinking about this some more it go a bit outside the scope of your op but i think it s worth mentioning because i sense that you are possibly just starting to get sucked in to the i m a bad parent if i do nt disease a a parent you will always be able to look around and see thing that other parent are doing and feel guilty that you are nt doing them too maybe it s because you do nt have money to go on a trip or send them to an awesome camp or buy them a piano or maybe you do nt have the timeflexibilityskills to go camping or be the cookie mom or volunteer at school but for virtually all of u there simply are nt the resource to do everything you feel you should do and that s ok the other thing can be great but at the end of the day what matter is keeping your kid feeling safe loved and supported and you can do that with limited resource
AH case cause you acted like a cunt and someone called you one nice case bro

NONE if someone is dehydrated and you have a bottle of water you must be forced to give that person water if they ve got their own bottle but ask for yours you do nt have to give it up under slavery you have to give it up no matter what
AH a a matter of fact i do believe that i should nt be penalized for the inefficient bathroom usage of woman so kinda you re making a generalization over all woman this is a silly a if i were to say i do believe that i should nt be penalized for the high crime rate of black people so we should have segregated community but that wa nt my point i just wanted to highlight that your argument is worse than useless it is misrepresenting the truth to fit your own agenda and the only thing worse then misrepresenting fact is to to it so badly that the people you want to convince can see through it immediately bullshit though congratulation on using two paragraph to say nothing of substance
NONE i agree that it s not necessary to point out explicitly that the name are changed but i think you re overlooking a reason people want to call attention to it lying about name feel wrong it s difficult to write something with the name changed because of course the name are all the true one in the writer s head and they have to remember to keep swapping them and for most people that feels dishonest even though objectively they know it is nt pointing it out explicitly is a way of making it feel le like a lie because you re being open about the change of name it may not be necessary but it s more comfortable for the poster it s not the most important reason in the world but given that it doe nt cause any harm it seems like reason enough if people want to do it
AH reddit love to say this nonstop but it s bullshit if you say funner or any of those other word you re an uneducated hick and if able i will walk away from you disappointed
NONE i m just going to stop pretending i can get you or apparently anyone to acknowledge the difference between microeconomic decisionmaking and market price so whatever
AH way to completely ignore all of the actual content of my post to make an empty insult i m sure you re just a rigorous and intellectually honest in your professional life
NONE it s no different than straight people choosing celibacy anyone looking down on you for making that choice need to review their own life do nt change your view
AH are you troll like are you serious because im starting to think you are a troll you have all the hallmark of a troll you avoid all rebuttal to your argument you constantly claim that someone doesnt understand what you are saying yet you never actually clarified what you were saying and now you are saying im gaslighting and victim blaming who the fuck is a victim here wtf wow im done you are going down a a troll in my book
NONE are you married to someone rich no then this is all just smoke blown up the as i have no idea what the point of this post is this is just nonsense common sense do you want money you should get a job and do work for someone then they give you money if you want to marry rich hang around rich people if you want a hamburger you can buy one from a place called mcdonalds redditor for hour oh that s why
AH you re sickeningly hypocritical and the mental gymnastics you re doing deserves a gold medal i m not having a fit i m just sort of bewildered by how dense and simple you must be in your world deceit deserves reward i feel bad for you because you genuinely believe the complete idiocy you re spouting that of course conviently help someone who is a woman i assume you are correct me if i m wrong pro tip cap lock doe nt help your argument all it doe is show that you have the mentality of an adolescent and still write like one
NONE it is difficult i agree my point is simply that some people feel so strongly about a particular event that they want it to remain part of them a tattoo is a way to achieve that i think you re exaggerating how badly tattoo age here they ll only start looking particularly bad a your skin begin to wrinkle and there really is nt much of what i d call an interim phase what about a tattoo on your back i can imagine going topless might be an issue but again i think tattoo are meant to be a form of expression and i do nt think they age all too badly
AH yes biological reproduction the overriding purpose of literally all life is culturally ingrained get sterilized up there for the least intelligent thing i ve read on reddit and thats saying something
NONE weird link is working for me it s citation in the wiki article in arguing for my own delta i would say i ve changed your view by demonstrating that there are people for whom tulpas is a culturally normative and mentally healthy thing
AH you ca nt even read leave me alone
NONE yes but we still do nt want hillary
AH ugh you sexist do nt you know that if woman control everything then we can get men equal right in regard to reproductive right and crime sentencing but in all seriousness the social justice push probably is nt the way to go about this issue feminist say theyre for equality yet some hate men rebranding wo nt make these people go away they ll still push for the everyone is equal but only in select feilds the demand for woman in trash management or other trade ha yet to be called for like they call for woman in stem arguably equality wo nt be achieved because each gender ha different strength and pretending those do nt exist wo nt help achieve equality rebranding is not the answer equality is utopia the best anyone can hope for is that everyone is more or le happy with the pro and con of the life they were born into
NONE well that s a terrible reason to vote for anyone in the first place you should vote for what you feel is best for the country or you not out of spite for what appears to you a someone else s stupidity it depends on what these people s interest are sure voting for the gop a a poor person is pretty fucking dumb when it come to your economicsocial safety net interest but maybe these are people that are also interested in preventing thing like abortion gay marriage or gun control just because a person vote against their economic interest doe nt mean they do nt have other interest that they feel are more important that get them to vote for republican people do nt always align perfectly with party ideologically and they often have to decide what issue are most important to them
AH yeah their plan is if you ca nt afford insurance tough shit for you a war on the poor if that s what you think you need to work on your reading comprehension
NONE how is homer here any better than a homer who did nt vote when you abstain you are letting everyone else decide on your behalf and reducing the level of support needed to make government
AH no it s not you told me that i m a sad confused soul because that wa more important than actually making a point and now you re back tracking you have no reason to be offended go fuck yourself
NONE i m glad you found that helpful a woman being antiman just to clarify it s not being antiman a a woman the best way i can explain it is a heightened alertness around strange men
AH and if the u ceased military action at this moment in time the world would likely be worse for it overall yeah if only the usa would just keep bombing the middle east we ll get peace how fucking blind are you this kind of ignorance is what ha led to repeated terrorist attack against the usa and it ally and the creation of a religion fanatical government trying to take over the middle east and your answer is more violence that wa under nixon who resigned before impeachment it wa also technically more than year ago i m not going to argue that nixon wa one of our more ethical president damn you nixon for destroying libya iraq afghanistan syria and more it s all your fault nixon the modern president are so dreamy and awesome they re just trying to do good thing it allt hat evil nixon s fault go live abroad in the country you are supporting destroying and see how wonderful the usa s aid ha been or continue talking out your as about thing you clearly have very little knowledge of
NONE i thought obama s critique of the governor wa priceless barry is upset about a founding idea of this country being ignored which is completely disingenuous since one of these guy lit up paris but he ha absolutely no problem trying to kill an amendment to the constitution king barry you ca nt have it both way you especially ca nt bring in a bunch of syrian refugee while you take away citizen ability to protect themselves it s lunacy it really is i feel for those folk in syria that are homeless because king obama disregarded the advice of every military advisor and nearly every one of his senior staff by pulling out of iraq creating isi and being party to aggravating civil war in syria that caused the refugee crisis barry caused this mess he ha no room to preach btw i m not a republican i vote down the middle or to the left but i know bullshit when i hear it

NONE i like you you do nt give up we d send you first over the trench and into no man land for king and country
AH that just show how unreasonable you are same go for op the real cmv here is that trump supporter are nt deplorables and have the same intellect and awareness a everyone else the only reality being highlighted here is that you and your peer fail to comprehend your dissenter you are the unreasonable one and are ending the discussion before it even start i completely understand every belief that liberal have and acknowledge their reason for it if you cant fathom the same for trump supporter then take a stab at who are the tougher people to reason with harboring a false sense of intellectual superiority is a showcase of ignorance people voted for trump trump is fulfilling the majority of his campaign promise why would that make people who still support him more unreasonable in your mind you do nt make sense and are floating around in the redditmsm bubble
NONE well the onus just simply is on the oppressed to convince the oppressor i put that word is scare quote because not every white person had a hand in slavery and not every member of any group is responsible for the larger group transgression why is the onus on woman to convince men because they re the one challenging the status quo it s about bein practical it is easy and understandable that some people get emotional about these issue but yelling oppressor at people doe nt change mind and just make you look pushy and obnoxious even of you are right wan na change the world be exactly who and what you are and be the most successful and simultaneously nice and friendly version of yourself demand respect but give it i m not saying it is fair that gay people have had the road the have but it is by coming out and beig ourselves that we changed mind by being ever present not by being in the way doe this make sense
AH ok calm down cops are bastsrds is nt that an unnecessarily general statement should we examine what informs the message in your user name or how you made this astute determination based on only a sliver of the police officer population who abuse their power i would contend that your immature and irrational mentality towards cop is much shittier than anyone else s inability to cope with the rapidly changing landscape of gender politics people are entitled to their opinion and many need time to process the development unfortunately for moron like you that do nt understand nuance you mistake uncertainty and ambiguity for something different and you instead pollute the rest of u with downright idiotic statement that are much further from reality than any latent sexual phobia to me it seems like you suck but that s just you know my opinion
NONE i just want to clarify here you are saying that the political social and economic order which rose to prominence after the european enlightenment is evil i m not sure if it is possible to debate this concept a it take such an incredibly wide range of school of thought societal action individual action and disparate event and lump them all together i would appreciate some sort of definition a to how you are defining evil because it is such a nebulous term and without it i do nt know what you consider good maximization of freedom standard of living of living for greatest number of people everyone ha their own my problem with your post is that by lumping together so many different thing it make it difficult to convincingly argue against i could just a easily say that humans are evil because they brought about the rise of modernity but it doe nt leave much room for discussion
AH well i would nt want to exacerbate your repetitive stress injury if you think of anything to say feel free to come back anytime in the next six month get well soon hope your repetitive stress injury doe nt cause you too much trouble in the future

NONE but you may just have to come to term with the fact that he s not your cup of tea
AH moonflower is a known transphobe
NONE rpolitics is the worst so is thedonald
AH folk love throwing around that phrase ad hominem i guess it make them feel smart the thing is the vast majority of the time they re using it incorrectly in the context of logic and argument ad hominem refers to a fallacy that draw a conclusion about an argument based on the character of the person making it if i were engaging in that fallacy i would be saying something like you re wrong because you re ignorant but i m not saying that i m just saying that you re wrong and you re also ignorant so why do nt you go play and let the grownups talk
NONE okay i believe i see your perspective on the argument if i recognize that your subjective value of thing will lead u to differ on what s morally permissible and what is nt it would be hypocritical of me to say you should stop eating meat the best i could hope to do without being a hypocrite is suggest you consider to stop eating meat i think because of the way i am and that i acknowledge there is nt really objective morality i implicitly equate argument of you should do x because y and you should consider doing x because y a the same thing whereas you do nt
AH lol ok tiger fyi it is possible to make logically consitent prolife argument all one need for it is a functioning brain
NONE it s only racist if it is specifically to mock the person s race otherwise people are just being pc weenie and need to chill
AH my take on your comment holy shit dude climb down off your fucking cross persecution complex much my wife s take on your comment i see him spewing a bunch of rhetoric but there s no substance i think he d be hardpressed to cite actual example of this my take on my wife s take he ll say he know many woman who hate anita sarkeesian similar to how people will say they have a black or gay friend after saying something douchey
NONE let s say bob is trans or just confused but this person is my friend and want s to be called sharon okay maybe it s a pain in the as but i go along with it if that s what they want who care i mean we do nt treat gender that differently in the st world so it would nt mean anything actually ha to change other than their name or our pronoun i honestly just do nt see what the big deal is
AH classic whataboutism trump being god awful doe nt mean hillary is nt god awful normally you d be right but we re not discussing hillary alone here the topic in question is how she measure up to trump trump s been caught in dozen of lie some of them about really basic shit hillary ha lied in the past i m sure but she s far above trump on the truthometer so calling hillary a liar is nt a very convincing argument when trump s objectively a much bigger liar calling hillary out for refusing to own up to certain mistake is nt a very convincing argument when trump doe far more of it in a way that s very easy to see saying hillary ha minor conflict of interest is nt a very convincing argument when trump ha far larger conflict of interest the discussion is nt would hillary have been a bad president the discussion is would hillary have been a better president than trump reading comprehension is your friend trump s problem are very relevant to the discussion http enwikipediaorgwikimilitaryinterventioninlibya http enwikipediaorgwikiamericanledinterventioninsyria so we re gon na call a campaign of drone strike and bombing an invasion in that case i suppose america ha invaded most of the middle east never mind just libya and syria we ve dropped bomb and sent spec ops team into over a dozen country to attack isi alone nevermind our campaign against al qaeda the qaddafi government and the various faction of the syrian civil war we are still in the iraq war we have had death this month alone http enwikipediaorgwikiiraqwar ha long after the science ha been in on the safety and efficacy of cannabis hillary s response to a question about legalization wa let s wait and see meanwhile she ha never supported any legislation that would actually make it happen incorrect source http wwwontheissuesorghillaryclintondrugshtm
NONE we do nt live in a democracy we live in a republic i know this wa a month ago but this point is so bad i have to try to combat it that line wa coined by republican trying to associate patriotism with their party i m not getting partisan here it wa a shrewd tactic a well a a way to get away from democracydemocrats that said the term democracy and republic have a lot of overlap even beyond that his point wa completely valid in every other way if you replaced democracy with republic in his comment it would have been accurate finally the two party thing is the fault of the voter like it or not not enough people want to stray outside the two party there s no concerted effort to suppress third position also stein and her running mate were arrested for refusing to move after being warned by police the rule that candidate need of national support to participate in debate is a good one otherwise what would stop me from signing up in my own party just to get on tv it s also worth noting that faithless member of the electoral college have never changed the outcome of a presidential election the idea that since sparsely populated state have fewer electoral vote they do nt matter is blatantly retarded oklahoma ha le vote than california because ok ha less people although the electoral college suck the idea that it invalidates your vote is horse shit every recent war ha been approved by congress i think you re missing a key point here every recent war ha been approved because otherwise no war would have occurred that s also not looking at the military engagement that were nt classified a war that congress did not approve
AH now i actually what you read about white rising up you are insane go fuck yourself and your sad scared little delusion
NONE i really hope your right and i hope it come to canada i m tired of all these mother fucking conservative won election
AH to avoid giving a clear definition of apartheid you need to reread the thread i ve been incredibly clear you will not accept any definition given either because you ve chosen the be purposely obtuse or because you re retarded either way talking to you more wo nt help you
NONE do nt we program ability rather than limit you seem to have a very simplistic view of programming generally if you program any system designed to learn you do nt know what it will do until you run it you ll probably have a general sense but people get surprised by the output of their program all the time
AH man what is your problem you sound like those annoying pretentious douchebags you meet in highschool my post wa not that philosophical and confusing everyone else in the thread knew exactly what i meant
NONE the only reason i like it is if someone is typing a message and then stop typing a message and never reply you know about it just kind of fit in with snapchats whole vibe kind of
AH thankyou someone else understood the point and i thought maybe the world had shifted and people had suddenly jumped ahead an evolutionary step crisis averted notice anything interesting about the way terrorism is treated in the medium what s the difference between what happened in oregon last year and any of the attack perpetrated by brown people that are so heavily reported and labelled a terrorism one is from an internal loony group we know about those they re a part of our cultural understanding they re internal so why is nt that creating the same kind of hysteria no wait i do nt trust you to answer that effectively it s because people are concerned about the external threat and not so worried about the internal one there are reason that this is the case i ve explained them just because you d rather sit on your very sensible position without trying to understand other people s position doe nt mean those other position stop existing or stop having cause and reason behind them
NONE maybe the poster to td and mat are just more comfortable with allowing their emotion to affect their view than i am and i suppose there s nothing wrong with that yeah what i m getting at is that if an intellectual space is set up a a support group for a given cause pro or anti trump in these case then the kind of discussion that go on there is very different than the kind of discussion that go on if it is set up for the purpose of interacting with people who do nt necessarily agree it s sort of like if you re not religious and you went to a church for the first time you re going to be confused and slightly baffled by what the people are doing and what the pastor is saying it s because the conversation is happening among likeminded people they are nt necessarily actually trying to engage in a debate with you a someone who is nt already bought into the general idea of christianity they re talking with other christian
AH where you re getting the notion that something must be intentional for it to be racist i have nt the slightest clue a it s completely unfounded and seemingly made up entirely again you seem to have tremendously poor reading comprehension i never said that something must be intentional for it to be racist merely that law and policy can not be racist without actually having a racial agenda behind them where you re getting that a political practice can be racist despite there being no racebased motivation or purpose i have nt the slightest clue disparate outcome for different racial group racism racism is discrimination intentional or unintentional based on race if the political practice is not based on race and is based on something else entirely then obviously it is nt racist the idea that gerrymandering to break up democrat influence is racist just because black people tend to vote democrat is completely absurd and calling it such diminishes the harshness of actual racism and actual discrimination based on race perhaps you should do some research perhaps you could gain some basic logic
NONE upreacherjudge brought up the distinction on prejudice and discrimination if you decide to award a delta you should give it to them a to whether or not prejudice can exist without discrimination i think that on a societal level it can not simply because i ve never seen it and i do nt think that it s ever happened that a society ha held a large degree of prejudice without marked discrimination being a part of that on an individual level i m doubtful personally i think that for someone to not have their prejudice turned into active discrimination they have to actively be trying to combat their prejudice acknowledging that it s there and might have an affect and thus being more critical of motivation or judgment or the like otherwise they are likely to be affected by it consciously or unconsciously in their action i would nt actually term a lot of prejudice action necessarily discrimination but that doe nt mean it still is nt harmful for instance if i buy into the prejudice that asian people are good at math and i get an asian math tutor because of it it s not really discriminating against the math tutor but it s still acting on a prejudice even if in this case that prejudice is nt obviously a harmful one to the affected group
AH lol at how you quoted half of op s paragraph rich people are not charged more for being more productive the progressive tax system mean that nobody is ever better off not making more money cut out the part about the progressive tax and then said yes they are we have a progressive tax system
NONE that s one option another is to convince them that they have already broken the law oh i would nt complain too much about your time sheet after all you signed those are incorrect number which mean you are committing tax fraud yeah you are nt being paid for all the hour you are working but it s still better than home right
AH because it would be the exact reason america doe nt have or want more of a welfare state you would be benefitting even more from the free rider problem even with high tax the western democratic model only work if we pick up most of your defense but you should at least maintain some independent defense force that is why i do nt get why european and australian dislike the u so much we are basically the adult in the room and you are the petulant teen heck maybe that is why you dislike u get a job first thsn you can bitch haha
NONE no one raindrop think it is responsible for the flood hardly any state ha much more than voter turnout if everyone who thought this actually got out and voted anyway they could literally do anything they wanted but i see your point so vote thirdparty what your vote can do is show the country that they do nt have to keep choosing between the same two terrible option get a third party to and they become a serious player which force the other two to stop being such ideologue and start coming up with actual answer to thing
AH this post gave me aid

NONE well i went to visit rbronyh to see if it look like hate speech and first off found a cartoon which made me feel sick but never mind moving on i think they are one of those community which will claim that they are only joking if they ever get called out on any hate speech so while there may be some genuine hate and nastiness hiding behind the only joking defence you will never be able to prove it like with sr and thebluepill etc etc
AH they re not at all actually i lived in an apartment supporting my family for year and just moved to a much larger house and now support my mother a well you could nt be more off base if you tried you condescending ignoramus

AH no i have no patience for moron who say stupid thing i m actually curious a to how you d ever think doctor can ignore something like a will and do whatever they want actually believing something like that make me wonder if you re just a troll because i ca nt believe anyone would be dumb enough to actually think that wa even remotely true
NONE of course not i d feel sympathy for their situation and i want to see them get the help that they deserve most people who are suicidal do nt actually want to die but they do nt see any other way to escape their situation i m not going to look down on someone who try to commit suicide but that doe nt mean i think it s alright to help them do it

NONE no i do nt but i did read about what is inside bill gate s house because he had a digital assistant and door that open themselves etc year ago it wa the only house of it s kind i think part of it is wanting to see how rich people live what is the best that life could offer on it s face it can be vain but for the people who follow it s not so i m not sure you can say it s absolutely vain it s basically in the eye of the beholder

AH are you trolling or just genuinely stupid ring the bell for ad hominem i never made any no true scotsman argument what i am pointing out is that the op is inquiring about liberal v conservative behaviour he is nt talking about political party he s talking about ideology you are very literally not addressing the thrust of this cmv if you really ca nt understand that party affiliation and political spectrum are not the same thing then i ca nt help you
NONE i think that young earth creationism is such a wild denial of basic scientific fact that if you believe in it you are automatically unfit to lead a superpower i agree evolution is a basic fact of science and anyone who denies it is an idiot but still i m voting for ben carson despite his ridiculous fear of science i m a republican and i know all republican politician are idiot so i have to choose my favorite idiot
AH i came into this thread thinking i would find an interesting discussion about a subject that i care a great deal about i m an egyptologist and although i specialize in the study of language i have had many argument with other egyptologist about repatriation opinion differ of course but the important point i want to make here is that real discussion about this include so so so much more than you ve said schliemann s crummy archaeology how is that even relevant to the question of repatriation of egyptian artifact oh because it s the one thing you know about what about petrie how doe petrie not get mentioned in your argument but schliemann doe right because you have no clue what you re talking about what about looting by islamist what about the likelihood of future instability in the middle east what about the contradiction between protecting cultural heritage that belongs to all humanity and reinforcing the effect of colonialism it is nt a simple a taking is stealing obviously and this will be my farewell to cmv because this is what it ha become bored ignorant moron hurrying to post the first counter argument they can pull out whether they have anything valuable to say or not it s basically debate club or discussing interesting topic with your friend over a beer it could be people with genuinely challenging question getting response from expert there are people who actually know about these thing who might have something to contribute on this particular subject i ve discussed it with the world s top egyptologist for year i or many other people on reddit might have something of value to add to op s understanding of this subject but you just could nt wait to get your dumb opinion out there could you
NONE i understand the dislike for reposted question but if no one asked question that had nt been asked before or were similar to question asked before there would very rarely be new content it will only get worse a more question are asked there s a difference between asking question that were asked once three month ago and asking question that were on the front page twice last week history is a longass time there will always be new question to ask sure if all of those comment were discussing the picts there would be more about the picts but i really do nt think the difference would be a severe a you claim and therein lie another piece of evidence to extend to my first point if you have huge general topic you wo nt have a many unique thread that can be searched or browsed for an accessible answer this is an overstated hypothetical to make a point but hopefully you get the idea if i ask what cause country to go to war that open up a huge debate about different anthropological thesis from huntington to zinn and all in between but if i ask why did these two group go to war it make more sense and the comment wo nt be filled with disjointed information that s not even a great example but you understand what i mean by broad topic but what that mod want is not what i want and an argument from authority is nt going to change my view on this but they enforce other policy that likely draw you to that subreddit that other people hate no matter what mod do some people are going to hate it in fact most people might hate it at first but if everyone give a little then you can keep the subreddit intact otherwise it s a freeforall like rfunny the mod of that subreddit can not cater to your specific want and disregard everyone else s
AH preguns the mongol built an empire with only a few casualty in relation to total global population the mongol killed somewhere around million people at a time when the world wa home to somewhere between million the mongol killed more than a tenth of the population and were the most devastating people in the history of the earth deadliest war second to ww which came at a time with a much greater world population
NONE which is fair because that wa only year after the war we are year away from the end of the civil war that s like generation away today compared to the civil war is the equivalent of wwi compared to the revolution i would imagine the british were very excited to see the american flag on the battlefield during wwi history get s whittled down to digestible fragment and people cling to the part that speak to them the most especially when it s been year

AH hahaha wow how retarded are you seriously google is free you need a good amount of history it your arrogance that make you seem not only inane but ridiculously ignorant good luck with that guy actually it usa colony you know usa s property

AH you asked provide the study that show gender identity distinct from sex is fixed at an early age i have already provided a study in which they proved the different brain structure is noticeable at age and therefore begin developing before age that is by all mean considered to be an early age and therefore i have already provided a study that show exactly what you asked for quite honestly your reading comprehension leaf much to be desired
NONE once you have determined it is a life it would be unacceptable to end it i think a huge portion of the populace would disagree let s say that at the start of the third trimester it is discovered that the fetus brain ha failed to form correctly and it will die almost immediately after birth most people would be more comfortable with abortion in that scenario compared to a normal situation at some point qualityoflife and abilitytocare become major factor in abortion

AH example i literally linked a wikipedia page with a dozen example what more do you want such a ours i explicitly stated our culture ha a two gender system what is it you do nt understand unless you want to adopt a system of gender in which of the population would become trans a a result none of this is logical all i did wa provide fact if you think fact are nt logical then you have a serious mental problem that i sincerely hope you address soon i have to say either you re year old and still learning or your reading comprehension is severely lacking
NONE it doe nt follow logically that because we are all human being we can not reasonably acquire all of the knowledge necessary to make a judgment what if i m an american with a doctorate in russian history i think that make my opinion more valid than even the average russian but what even is a more valid opinion i have a right to form a stance based on fact a much a they do and i d like to think i have access to the same fact possibly more fact in some case when the native population is medium suppressed and kept in ignorance also people of a country are more likely to be biased than me an outsider so maybe the opposite of what you say is true
AH yep because that s how school work got it
NONE yes it can thats why it s called utopian
AH he armed isi so yeah so fuck off with your it s a minority lie it s not a minority a majority of the muslim people are terrorist you start off with a failed argument so i m gon na ignore that wall of nonsense you posted up top muslim are cockroach and enemy of the nation there is nothing good about their continued existance in any county or on this planet the constition is an advisory doccument about what thing are nice it ha no binding it can be ignored freely whenever you want protestant are nt christian

AH if it can be rationally defended that an individual can exercise this right without infringing on the right of others while also being compelled by his nature to exercise said right then it is a right you just used the word right while you defined the word right do you understand why that would be a problem no actually that is what grant right the fact that human have thing they all naturally feel entitled too first of all again you re not arguing you re just contradicting secondly fact can not take action that fact may be a reason but it is not the agent that took the action of granting right intangible concept ca nt take action if you do nt understand that you re stone cold retarded no they are not they are granted by biological pattern in human behavior first of all again you re not arguing you re just contradicting secondly fact can not take action that fact may be a reason but it is not the agent that took the action of granting right intangible concept ca nt take action if you do nt understand that you re stone cold retarded you do nt have a definition yours is made up while mine is supported by constitutional law of not just the u but by many other country a well if you can give me a word without a made up definition i will mail you five dollar also your webster link lead to the definition of an adjective care to try again
NONE history would prove this to be a mute point brain do not equal good decision yes but you could say the same thing about any aspect of our life doe this not qualify a hurting part of society yes but you could say the same thing about any aspect of our life we must be very careful in setting law which govern these issue yes but you could say the same thing about any aspect of our life if you agree boundary must exist then you agree that it is possible for these thing to be abused given no boundary i agree however i think the only real boundary required would be to ensure that parent have the right to decide the trait of their own child and no one else this eliminates the possibility of any real abuse because the decisionmakers are also the one who are parenting or not in the case of abortion the resultant child i first responded to you because you said i d like to offer up a prolife argument that doe not consider whether or not the fetus is human while it s absolutely true that this idea selective abortion is something that could be dangerous if abused i do nt think that s a good enough reason on it own to oppose it however it is a good reason to ensure that we are careful to explicitly outline what is acceptable and what is not
AH i see how it is downvote for you too son
NONE i agree so i do nt make that distinction
AH it s more amazing how you have such a need to pretend to misunderstand so you can pretend to accuse me of something or are you really this dense or typical privileged white male i guess i ll never know you d lie to your mother if you thought you could profit from it
NONE i think there is no reason at all to speculate although it would be best to believe the most likely situation say you saw a lamborghini in the parking lot next to your car you drive off and tell yourself that someone would have given it to you if you had asked for it why kid yourself when you know the probable situation
AH or that you do nt believe men are in a position of privilege in society when did we stop being in that position in australia where i live it wa still legal to rape your wife in men dominate the majority of govt and industry at every level in every nation in the world there is no question that men are privileged in educated circle it go without saying in academia it just retard in reddit like you who believe this do you realise that
NONE so your thesis is just bad thing gon na happen i guess i can rebut that without denying your premise it may just become the case that woman will flock to the few say men who are above them in term of education or status those men will then have offer coming from all over likely prompting a resurgence of polyamorypolygamy it wa popular in many historical society so there s no reason it ca nt come back to fix the problem here
AH if you re already using it incorrectly then you do nt care obviously

NONE i hope i do nt sound like i m being nice all the time when i wa younger i definitely had an attitude but the bad treatment continued even when i got older and wa nice not at all you just seem like someone who s never had a break and is incredibly frustrated maybe the best thing for me is to be nice even if i m seething might keep the cop from getting madder maybe i m expecting too much for the cop to be polite it never hurt to say to a cop listen sirmaam please forgive me if i seem a little angry and do nt take offense i had a bad day it ll diffuse any potential anger on both part and the cop will appreciate the fact that you re not pissed at them
AH not sure if it s even worth responding to you since you re probably trolling but do yourself a favor and read the post before you respond to it
NONE i agree with you how do you feel about the person who initiated the date paying i feel like this is nonsexist commonsense and repeatable
AH you are ridiculous read the other source andor actually read the nyt piece and come back and tell me how it s infotainment otherwise enjoy your echo chamber and peace be with you
NONE i agree with you it s all smoke and mirror part of the illusion of freedom all that society doe is take away your freedom and then turn around and sell a fake version back to you with interest
AH and have you learned a valuable lesson about reading more carefully or asking clarifying question before jumping to the conclusion that the stranger you are talking to is an idiot or is that too much to hope for

NONE it s not about efficiency it s about acknowledging the human being in front of you by staying there staring at what they do you tell them that however mechanical their job is you acknowledge that they are there next to you for any job like a craft that is more creative you do nt need to do that industry or any job you do nt see would nt be practical a well if you keep talking on the phone do nt you think they might feel like you treat them like a robot visual input are not enough imo

AH it is really dishonest for you to admit an exemption that directly contradicts your cmv it implies that you are not actually willing to discus thing and have your mind changed a you immediately negate what would be used to convince you
NONE this whole discussion is similar to discussion of original sin since you ve liberated yourself from that guilt there s really nothing to convince you otherwise unless you decide that you need an intermediary for your salvation
AH well he s just a troll so do nt expect consistency
NONE i wa going to comment but you really summed it up nicely
AH i m saying it is an equal policy problem one life is worth the same a any other life the government should try to prevent harm in the most cost effective way which mean spending the most money on the biggest problem or the problem that are easiest to solve punishment doe not enter into it you re literally just ranting off about something else and are you a fucking idiot what could isi a syrian terrorist group do to undo antipoverty policy in the u nothing good nothing shut up then
NONE worker vote with their labor is that not enough if you do nt like the culture of a company then simply leave it is redundant to have government regulation protect freedom of speech when the deterrent of labor loss is enough a company should reap what it sow it is not up to the government to tell what a company can or can not do if a company treat me like dirt and is pretty much a fascist dictator then i ll just quit and find a job somewhere else there is no need for the government to reign in my employer

AH i find it interesting how i m the one denouncing creeping authoritarianism and you re the one calling that fascist you re not denouncing creeping authoritarianism you are denouncing increasing protection for the traditional victim of authoritarian the working class minority you are denouncing the dissolution of authoritarianism you are an authoritarian you are a disgusting hateful fascist who want to live in a society of naked prejudice and intolerance where employer rule the life of their employee and minority are subject to the hate and intolerance of the majority you re a stupid ignorant fuck of a human being your position is disingenuous to the core it is fascism hiding under the cloak of religious freedom but the only freedom you are defending are the freedom of those without power to be victimized by those with power bigotry noun intolerance to those who hold different opinion from oneself yes and that perfectly describes refusing to sell someone a cake because you think their lifestyle is morally depraved hmmm wishing ill will upon those who are different from you ah hah so you admit that bigotry and prejudice come from ill will earlier you claimed i m not saying it doe nt suck for the gay couple but it s not overtly malicious yet when i suggest that you should experience the very same prejudice and bigotry that you defend a a business owner s right then it becomes ill will you re a specious disingenuous asswipe and your belief are disgusting backwards and fascist eat shit you subhuman slimebag people like you are a fucking disease on society
NONE i think you re going to hear a lot about the way you re overgeneralizing or misrepresenting the view of farright christian and i think you re also underestimating the degree to which cultural value are retroactively validated by religion rather than the other way around but i m going to focus on the term malicious malice is the conscious desire to do harm it doe nt matter whether the motivation is hate fear anger disgust ignorance or a misguided need to follow certain passage of old holy book thinking of homosexual a secondclass citizen or advocating for policy that will actively discriminate against them is consciously doing them harm and while people will often cite that ignorance play a big role in this it is ignorance of the humanity of homosexual people that they are citing no one is ignorant to the fact that discrimination harm homosexual people i think what you re trying to get at is that there are a wider range of thought and emotion that lead people to denigrate homosexual and discriminate against them than can be encompassed in word like hate and homophobia ultimately though it doe nt matter all of those road eventually lead to the conscious doing of harm and that is malicious even if you do it with a smile on your lip and jesus in your heart

AH there is nt a medical debate on whether crack is physically addictive there is a debate on whether marijuana is ice cream is psychologically addicting and even given that there were any useful study that took into account the relevant social consideration of drug usage in a legal setting there still would nt be a fucking connection to productivity because there are many drug that are incredibly addictive which are known productivity enhancers the only way to measure if marijuana legalization enhancesreduces productivity is to fucking legalize it and see if our productivity go updown claiming anything else is talking out of your as
NONE the example i gave of a desirable regulation in my op wa iv drug their legal regulation would ensure more clean needle whereas the current prohibition encourages harmful needle sharing an indoor smoking ban is effective whether the drug is legal or illegal therefore this is not a compelling reason for legalization the supply of clean needle doe not require legalisation the health benefit you re using a a metric can be achieved with out legalisation i guess it is irrelevant to the legalization of most drug but that doe nt mean it s untrue anyway i contest that there are real drug which pas the test such a marijuana yes there are some negative side effect from smoking marijuana but it s not in the same league a tobacco that wa nt a part of your test i m not sure it affect my argument either way i added a minor edit that may clarify

NONE people who use the defense that what they do is legal are not usually arguing sincerely that what they do is right from a moral perspective edit because it is legal rather either they do nt consider their action immoral in the first place or do nt care whether their action were moral or not the principle they re using a a shield is not the idea that the law is always morally right very few adult believe that moral is identical with legal however most people agree that there is a general moral principle that you should follow law a law are usually in place for the good of society if no one followed any law we d be pretty badly off so when someone say that the immoral action they took wa legal we should nt read it a thinking law define morality instead we should view law a an additional moral constraint we place on ourselves to avoid violence and chaos
AH wow you have zero sense of perspective and are a disgusting person do you work in the medical field in the u how do you explain the lower healthcare cost in nation that have single payer anyway i am confident that if you were born a a white person in the s you would have been passionately arguing for slavery it s not that white slaveowners are doing anything wrong it s that black people are born naturally inferior and stupid and so it s in the natural order of thing for white people to be in charge in the status quo the black people would be useless parasite so it s up to the white man to force them to work it s not causing any harm it s just the way thing are
NONE i think i understand what you mean a i also find the notion of pride in anything sexuality or race to be kind of pointless that said i do think what they are actually going for is dignity to be able to say this is who i am i m not going to hide it and i m not a lesser human being because of it it is true that this wa much more of an issue in the past but there are still people even in the western world who are discriminated against beaten or even killed because of their sexual orientation it s great that you are nt one of those people but i think it is more about standing up for those who do face those issue you feel a hell of a lot stronger with an army at your back

NONE here are my thought jordan find out in just the remaining second that he can play like a cartoon character the monstars only have player on point jordan s new found ability to stretch and dunk from half court is a game changer he can now dunk for point at any time he chooses while being fouled with the monstars only having player a fairly refereed game would likely result in at least monstar fouling out each game creating quite the edge also considering the referee told jordan that if they did nt have a th player they would be forced to forfeit then the monstars would need to make sure they were never injured additionally while the mosntars have the talent of the all star they do not have the basketball iq they were just learning about the game from a film from the s and would not be able to strategize in the same way that the tune squad would be able to they likely do nt even know about the point shot all in all a fairly called game should allow the smarter and capable tune squad to walk away victorious against the athletically superior monstars

NONE the reality is these type of people you are associating with have a deep seated hatred for straight white men in their eye such men are the oppressor i suggest changing your belief and finding new people to associate with anything short of that will leave you in a state of cognitive dissonance
AH that s exactly what i meant when i said your upbringing wa the cause of your toxic ideology growing up in a small rural town riddled with poverty narrowed your world view and thus gave you a simplistic idea of justice being taking an eye for an eye you believe that suffering can only be countered with more suffering and because of your upbringing you now have an twisted view of the desperate and the unfortunate a animal you believe that conditioning the population through fear is a justified tactic to force them to accept and bow before authority your ideology is commonly called conservatism and it is a barbaric and appalling moral framework that caters to the emotional desire for revenge
NONE the people calling this good parenting just like seeing the rioter being beat up lot of them just like seeing young black men they ve decided are bad being beat up period an impulse that is exactly what the uprising is about be critical of that be critical of the whole framing rather than accepting the frame and arguing from within it about whether she s a good or bad or okay parent the attempt to make the issue of what is going on in baltimore about parenting or individual responsibility is ridiculous and a distraction it s about the type of systemic oppression that cause people to be disenfranchished angry and fearful for themselves and their kid and their future
AH serving a person s event is serving the person if i throw a birthday party for myself and order pizza the pizza place is serving me by serving my event or you can think of it a they re serving me the pizza and i in turn am serving someall of the pizza served to me to my friend no they are serving an event because that s what is happening you re trying to argue with people s stated motivation which doe nt make sense you ca nt tell somebody why they re doing what they re doing you re wrong about the actual fact serving an event is not identical to serving an individual person and you re wrong to ignore people s motivation btw you re also wrong because the people eating at the event are not the same people if i give you a bagel to eat that s different from me giving your friend bagel to eat it s different because again it s just a different thing and that s undeniable but it s also different because you are not your friend you re you you could nt be any more wrong i do nt think that they would agree either way and i do nt think that this matter for the topic of this discussion much like a pizza place giving me pizza i ordered for my birthday party is serving me regardless of whether or not i eat any of it selling or not selling a cake that a samesex couple us at their wedding reception is serving or not serving that couple wtf is wrong with you i have literally given you at least or separate line of reasoning that all literally prove you re wrong and you just dismiss them for no reason scenario i give a gay person a bagel to eat scenario i give a bunch of people cake to eat except for the gay person from scenario you re literally saying these two scenario are the same you re a fucking idiot good bye

NONE you re not acknowledging that a lot of people who become vegetariansvegans do so to alleviate animal suffering and not out of any specific desire to eat healthily do you see nothing funny about someone pointing out that you re not acknowledging something and then when you reply you completely ignore that they pointed that out you re ignoring the only thing that matter and are instead opting to focus on completely irrelevant tangent here is the scenario if someone think it s immoral to eat animal they wo nt eat animal this make no commentary on any other eating practice they may have

NONE english is a hard language you got that right one additional thing that may contribute to the problem is that have to is used in the context of school a lot you have to show your work when doing math there is a rule that you show your work if you break the rule you lose point so if you say something like the potus should have to do something like a school assignment it almost going to be taken to mean that it is a test requirement anyway to return to your cmw it seems like you want the president to not be ignorant in some way i think the response you are getting do eventually get to the point of confusion why do you think naming all state is so important i expect the potus to be able to tie their shoe but they can be a good president even if they ca nt i feel the same way about the state

AH are you fucking kidding me those two statement are not in conflict any person ha access to any of those school that doe nt mean each individual school is the same what you argued wa a strawman because i said there is equality in access and then you proved me wrong by saying i originally argued that all school are the same ostensibly you do not comprehend the difference between these two statement i assure you there is one you say you want equal opportunity but what you are arguing is for equality in outcome yes yes little sheep continue strawmanning what i say i clearly made an indictment of all thing governmentrun are you so afraid to question your own preconceived notion that you must misrepresent everything i write in order to make it fit your neat little narrative of the world i pity you i m not penalizing anyone s child i m saying it not the government s role to decide who win and loses it the individual role this country is founded on the idea that you work hard and you can achieve middle class status it not founded on the idea that middle class status will be handed to you on a silver platter by some government bureaucrat but go ahead make your moral inquisition on that statement and take the high road i m sure it will help you sleep at night
NONE that doe nt mean state sanction enforcement of consequence again it s easy to come up with example when denying anonymity aligns with our own interest no one feel bad about limiting the right and protection of white supremacist but that can be turned against you and something you believe in just a easily i can understand that i empathize i even think it s reasonable i do nt however think that the perception of a threat is justification for limiting someonees freedom of expression which is what the way we dress ourselves fall under some people feel threatened by being on a plane with muslim i would nt support them making it illegal for muslim to be on a plane a slippery slope argument is not necessarily a fallacy you re arguing in favor of giving the government an additional power to arrest people i outlined a potential scenario for abuse of that power unlike individual i do think that we should limit government freedom according to what they might do with it we can evaluate and judge people on a situational basis of what ha already happened but with creating law we have to consider what is possible that s not a fallacy i do nt see why on what basis do you assert that responsibility where is it enshrined in the constitution in philosophy it seems to me like a personal value a perfectly good one but i do nt see it a a moral imperative that a criminalized action should be based on may i ask why you want this view changed you never mentioned
AH historically the u military wa used to oppress native american the u army wa established in http enwikipediaorgwikiunitedstatesarmy well after the native american massacre the french military wa used to colonize foreign land they still do http enwikipediaorgwikilistoffrenchpossessionsandcolonies what s your point the israeli military ha been used against jordanian and egyptian city such a vague claim give me a source for a particular event you are referring to the russian military wa used to attack chechen and georgian they ve sure changed their way in ukraine it look like a whole bunch of the world ha no right to self defense the mental acrobatics you perform here are amazing also you entirely missed my point here it is again the palestinian have never used their military in self defense rule please i wa nt rude nor hostile calling someone a second class citizen because they re demilitarized is moronic hyperbole if i demanded that israel demilitarize i would be rightly accused of treating jew a second class citizen and whoever accused you of that would be making a moronic hyperbole some reading for you http enwikipediaorgwikisecondclasscitizen
NONE human nature doe nt change but society improves and hopefully collectively prevents the bad part of human nature from achievement how close were we to nuclear war before the fall of the ussr not even counting the various third world genocide since you excluded them how about bosnia these are people who should have learned the lesson of wwii but clearly did nt i do think we are getting better a a specie but to declare that we are somehow beyond genocide is not only wrong but dangerous the u considered using nuclear weapon http wwwhaaretzcomworldnews against afghanistan after do you really think that if it happened again that there would nt be a significant percentage of american supporting blowing those bastard back to the stone age we re still kind of working on that a a human race but the bible even some religious people do nt think it s mostly still relevant the law at least my point wa nt the rule of the bible but the story if you look at how the people in it act they could be character in a popular novel or a lifetime movie selfish petty foolish if we have nt changed over two millennium it s not likely that we ve changed fundamentally in year

AH stop trying to make inference about me based on my post they re all completely wrong and it make you sound like a judgmental idiot i do nt buy your constitutional argument from a thing change perspective first off we ca nt ignore the politics before roosevelt this wa not the policy of the court and the development you speak of that allowed quicker interstate commerce had been there for decade keynes did not invent supply and demand and there had been major panic before interstate also doe nt mean far away new york boston and philadelphia are near state border and their trade with other state were also regulated under this power and the fact that the founding father could nt imagine the future doe nt mean you get to ignore the constitution and do whatever you think will work keynesian theory is nt a legitimate constitutional argument i do not understand why you think i would invalidate congress s power over interstate commerce maybe i m just reading you wrong your whole first point make no sense the way you worded it i admit i wa wrong about state drug law but how many major intrastate drug corporation are there i wa nt trying to say that the civil right act of should be unconstitutional and that the state will pick up the slack although after all this time most of them probably would because it would look really really bad if they did nt i wa trying to say that there can be other way to constitutionally justify this congressional action perhaps by defending some implied right you say they had no other mean to do so but you do nt elaborate
NONE i believe unprecedented crime should call for unprecedented action to be taken i am just going to address this quote here regardless of what crime is committed or by whom i feel that all of u should support the rule of law the law presently regarding presidential succession is spelled out pretty well in the constitution and there is nt really a lot of room for argument about what that law is who would have the authority to decide when these unprecedented crime have occurred there is no higher authority who can say that we need to do this kind of random unprecedented thing because this unusual circumstance ha occurred congress could pas legislation to try to do what you suggest but i d guess the supreme court would strike it down and it would be there simply is no authority or mechanism to do what you suggest bottom line we have law we need to follow them if you do nt like the outcome of a law there are way to get it changed for the future that is the way constitutional government work and i would suggest this is a very good thing now how about this trump get impeached penny becomes president penny get investigated for his role in the collusion with russia if the impeachment is successful paul ryan become president that will take a good amount of time to get through all that process and by that time we might a well just wait for the next election cycle there we have followed the law and gotten pretty close to what you want
AH palestinian have no right to self defense against whom historically the palestinian s use of military ha been to attack israeli civilian either palestinian should be fully equal and incorporated into israel or should be fully free to determine their own destiny a an independent state a state that s allowed to raise army have you ever heard of wwii the demilitarization of germany japan demanding that palestinian voluntarily remain second class citizen enough with this moronic hyperbole demilitarizing doe not make them second class citizen
NONE the government of the united state and ukraine have both denounced russia s action a against international law well for one they attacked ukraine with soldier who did nt show heir flag that s mega illegal when wa it decided that country could not try to change their border through force do nt think of it necessarily a a moral thing think of it a a mexican standoff after wwii everyone realized the threat one country can pose which violates the universal truce among all nation without due cause thus we view an attack on one a an attack on all of u and have made law condemning it
AH you are fucking delusional jesus christ just kill yourself
NONE people stop with your war against the rich jesus christ
AH well if you actually cared enough to actually read report like the most recent home mortgage report http wwwfederalreservegovpubsbulletinpdfhmdapdf you would see that low income housing area are avoided for numerous reason poverty crime and generally speaking the stupidly high interest rate they have to charge to be able to break even on the nonconventional loan the poor are known for taking out but of course you rather think that all bank are racist and not just merit lending i know i know doe nt fit the narrative

NONE and that s what science is admitting what we do nt know and making stride towards becoming knowledgeable on it it s troubling for some but for me it s exhilarating this is off topic but it wa a civil and interesting conversation which are few and far between and for that i thank you
AH i showed you evidence start using those debate skill now let me break it down for you since you are not smart enough to read and correlate and respond accordingly first thing is first point out what state in which it is illegal for woman to get birth control do you deny that woman are not punished for rape equally a men do you deny that woman are not punished equally for pedophilia do you deny that men get no free birth control de you deny that men get no free cancer screening do you deny that woman are the main abuser of child in domestic case do you deny that men are the first assumed guilty in domestic violence call you have a lot to refute without educating yourself or offering countering information to my claim how are we fixing the problem we are pointing them out a i am doing right now just to be answered with a calloused shotgunning whatabouts and blaming feminist and woman without actually reading what i said and saying hmmm let me see if i can refute this with my information which you ca nt
NONE i have nt seen this point raised throughout the thread yet and i hope it will allow you to rethink your entire premise you keep mentioning people who ca nt afford a child should nt have one women is what you mean to say your viewpoint specifically and overwhelmingly harm woman and target woman based upon thing which they can not control woman have no way to just shut down their biology you re entire premise is an attack on woman and violates their inalienable right to control over their body what happens to a rape victim who doe nt fit the criterion for being able to have a child is she now after being forced into one horrific act upon her body now to have her own government do the same to her how doe this law even apply to men at all you re advocating law against one gender and not the other that s not only against the law in most country already but extremely amoral and disgusting you say being poor is something people can change well being born a woman is nt something you can it s a stoneskip away from making law about not being able to do certain thing because of other factor not in your control like skin color
AH careful you re gon na make a few male redditors jealous here
NONE i m not gon na try and change your view because it is a good veiw
AH not that i ve ever found an ancap to be bothered about having an actual discussion you do nt deserve to post in this sub you do nt deserve it you are a hypocrite i have had nothing but pleasent conversation and then you show up
NONE thanks you for posting this because i do nt get it either and even after reading response i m not convinced it should have gotten the backlash it did edit i mean when wa the last time a comedian wa called out for being misogynist
AH you sound like a literal autist who doe nt get figure of speech and such
NONE it s ok to have a different skin color a long a you dress and act just like me
AH they do respect all the guideline it is free speech it is not like they go out and find non believer for the faith of allah lol big difference dont be such a commie
NONE it is the same thing you do nt like it you leave yes people do not like it yet they do not leave maybe there are other thing to stay for shade of grey rather than black and white
AH huge difference no stealing is a good law you have to drive on this road where is safe is a bad law yes that s my opinion and yes i get to act on it i know this is a new concept to you actually using your brain to decide what make sense instead of blindly following the government s law a if they were a holy document but i suggest you try it sometime the law is the law no ugh just stop this shit argument would lead people to looking down upon martin leuther king pot smoker prostitute and all kind of harmless thing because the law s the law no the law is nt just the law bad law are nt worthy of my respect yes i get to decide which law are bad one i hate people who say that you re the same people who will look at someone being carted off to jail for some victimless crime like pot smoking and saying aw shuck that really suck for them i wish thing were different but tha law s the law do the crime do the time instead of calling it out a the crime against humanity that it is stop respecting the law so much just because it s the law use the brain you were given to discern fair law from unfair one do nt be blindly obedient like a dumb dog you do nt get to bend this just because you want to yes we can and we do you have way way too much respect for authority to me authority come only from logic and fact not topdown from politician and majority consensus create a device that can perfectly display the percentile range of safe speed on the road factoring in weather condition and congestion and through analyzing all past traffic incident on similar road in similar condition now that get my respect put up a sign that say the local gedhaving police force say go here and i could nt give le of a fuck
NONE okay i have more of an issue with this entire premise of a you say cracking down you make this seem a though a crack down on illegal thing is somehow bad i would say that among a group of random woman and a group of random terrorist one of those group is definitely more of a detriment to our society and should be treated a such if we have le terrorist they commit heinous crime le and that is a good and beneficial thing to happen in our society you list the judicial branch a something that he want to crack down on i m unsure what this mean but i will say that one of the biggest reason i support trump currently is his pick for the supreme court neil gorsuch he is an originalist and they tend to read and interpret the law a it wa meant to be at the time it wa written and they do nt often grab for power that the court should nt have if that is somehow subjecting someone to punishment that is undeserved i d love to be proven wrong i also think saying that someone is trying to implement a crack down on gun restriction is kind of an interesting thing to say considering the word restrict is a soft synonym to the phrase crack down on i would argue the gun restriction themselves are the crackdown and he would remove them overall i disagree both with the idea that all of his supporter want this crack down you speak of some of them want him president for purely economic reason and i disagree with the idea that this crack down on certain thing doe not help create a brighter future i ll leave you with this if i said i wa going to really crack down on all crime so that all crime go to an all time low is nt that beneficial to society i d love your feedback
AH morally obligated who s moral yours because a a trans woman i certainly do nt feel morally obligated to reveal my medical history before a one night stand i probably still would because i do nt want to get beaten to death by someone like the op but would nt feel morally obligated and obviously i would tell them in a relationship but that s another story anyways op i hope you accidentally have sex with a trans woman and get infected with the gay or whatever you re so worried about
NONE yeah this happens to me sometimes where someone will ask if i m married and then when i reply yes they ask about my wife at that point there s just no way for me to make the encounter not awkward i kindly correct them and tell them that i have a husband and then they apologize and get visibly uncomfortable it s really not that hard just do nt assume people are straight i actually internally assume everyone is bisexual that way i m never surprised

NONE firstly i m going to ignore the fact that the health impact of smoking are vastly more than lung cancer i do nt think debating these statistic is not particularly important to my or your position then i can think of literally a hundred thing we say about fat people to insult them for being fat lazy ugly disgusting and so on while there is a counterpoint to this based on tolerance of it that doe nt exist for smoking i believe it is horribly innacurate to say that we do nt stigmatize fat people in our society secondly there is a difference in my opinion for having a complex addictionbased problem with a substance that is necessary for survival vs one that is consumed exclusively for pleasure if the alcoholic had to have a drink time a day but still say sober a part of their recovery then we d have way fewer recovered alcoholic if the overeater stop consuming the substance of their addiction then they die that s a significantly greater challenge than the smoker face thirdly if i find smoking to be disgusting then your smoke is disgusting and it literally come into my space while i think it s fair to discus some level of contagiousness with regard to obesity and lifestyle habit that lead to it it s also true that if i m in public and the fat person is eating it ha no greater impact on me than when the skinny person is eating not only do i not smell it it s not like of the calorie the fat person eat somehow land in my stomach and make me fatter

NONE i highly doubt it do nt just doubt find out what do you think you know and how do you think you know it what do you believe and why do you believe it do you have any evidence to point towards that hypothesis do you have example of bullying program that have nt worked do you have example of bullying program that have the point is this doing anything is better than doing nothing if i just start throwing various chemical at each other and testing them i have a very slim chance at randomly discovering cancer it would be better if i altered my methodology but i have an infinitely better chance of curing cancer that way than if i just did nt try anything
AH really first op is starting a discussion about intellectual dishonesty i think pointing out that op is engaging in blatant intellectual dishonesty to do that is absolutely fine what is nt fine is making loweffort comment like yours on this sub so edit it to make a point or i will happily ignore you second nowhere did i insult anyone i used some naughty word maybe you re confused by that
NONE what benefit do we get a a society from kicking them out this question continues you missing the point benefit or drawback do nt matter breaking the rule and getting ahead from it is inherently bad punishing that is inherently good end of story i know you do nt share this way of looking at thing i do nt either but it s a common motivation that is nt racist
AH what what doe pregnancy have to do with it she is per definition le productive you have nt read the context of the hypothetical she we re discussing have you you seem like a very dishonest person
NONE well technically you ca nt prove anything the best we can say is that it s very very likely something is true so again you d need a threshold to determine what is statistically motivated and what is nt
AH there is no right to breath and if your do nt realize the ignorance of that statement you re just an idiot
NONE reddit is filled with manchildren of course it should be looked down upon but nobody will tell you that here
AH something tell me you re full of shit with that first statement second i m sure you realize how stupid the second one is huge difference between an uninseminated and egg and sperm and an unborn child that is on it way to being born why are you so afraid to accept the reality of the situation
NONE every child you bring into the world will die most of them will have a hard life mortality is the hardest part about being human because we re one of the only animal who face it a a conceptbut that ca nt stop the cycle if there s a sliver of a chance i believe that we should shoot for it
AH trump won because people ca nt objectively look at data and come to the obvious conclusion i m seeing this denial of reality because of bias right now it s an incredible sight after watching you deny reality and fact right in front of your face it s apparent how delusional people are you make the argument a few degree is nothing because the earth varies in temperature from place to place and month to month that idea is beyond stupid and rejected by every single publication on the topic from the mainstream medium to science journal every single one agrees even small change in the earth average temperature ha dramatic impact the entire premise behind your theory is just false you have zero source to back up any of your claim and the basis of your unsubstantiated claim are just so incredibly childish and narrow minded i do nt eat fish ha to be one of the stupidest thing i ve heard uttered
NONE well now it s down to what level of intensity is appropriate for coverage and there it get kind of sticky imagine that the medium had always been covering mass shooting a you suggest would american be a aware of the national mental health crisis probably not a they would only know that shadowy unknown killer were striking across the nation in the absence of detail we assume the worst people would make up detail and those rumor would get spread around a fact it is the job of the medium to report on what people care about and find relevant i agree that many of the more salacious detail are included in extremely poor taste but there is a demand out there for it and if it come down to choosing between letting people embarrass themselves with their own poor taste or forcing everyone to live in ignorance of the truth i ll take the former every time
AH yes i know idiot often laugh at thing that confuse them
NONE lol k i m not even going to bother reading that see ya 👋😎
AH no see i wa explaining why you should let go of your death grip on rhetorical correctness because rhetorical correctness doe not necessarily describe what emotion will occur in a particular situation and how you should acknowledge reality rather than obstinately deny them because you re only going to continue to hurt people by continuing a you have been no not concerned by that sure okay nothing you ve commented at any stage give me any reason to think you re even capable of reading that much in oh you had seven minute at absolute maximum nah you did nt even read it once well then go fuck yourself you heartless imbecile
NONE i do nt disagree but changing your way is different that d be like you now feeling morally superior because you ve stopped texting and driving than someone who continues to do it and i d agree completely that at that point you do have moral superiority because you ve corrected yourself edit the moral aspect of this is the disregard for the safety of others in this sense no matter how good you are at it you re equally immoral because you have still placed your own convenience above concern for other people just because you re talented doe nt change that it s the selfcenteredness that is immoral and it s equally present in someone who s good at texting a it is in someone who is nt
AH she certainly doe nt lie a shamelessly a trump are you ok hillary lying for minute http youtubedyjubhi hillary lying for another minute http youtubeftxsojiakg trey gowdy dismantles every clinton lie http youtubedlmaqxcysxk she s a compulsive liar take a lap and then do some more research
NONE just to add to the discussion this wa already a big thing a while ago in europe the right to be forgotten http enwikipediaorgwikirighttobeforgotten that s why it s now possible for european to ask google to remove old news story about themselves from their index http forgetmefaq

NONE is fiction truly of some use you ever try and hit on a guygirl by talking about what medium they consume
AH because the level of physical damage done is irrelevant to the crime committed wow tell that to a judge and jury the amount of physical damage done absolutely is relevant to which crime is committed there are different crime and sentencing guideline that are based on the amount of damage done a person could be raped and beaten bloody in the process or they can be raped and not a mark left on them doe that mean the second one wa le raped no but it mean they were le beaten you realize that these are two separate crime that the criminal can be charged with do nt you what a terrible argument it is irrelevant what the sex of your assaulter wa how hard they hit or what the damage wa lol you idiot how hard they hit and how much damage they do can be the difference between assault aggravated assault assault with attempt to do great bodily harm le than murder battery attempted murder manslaughter nd degree murder i could go on and on how hard they hit and how much damage they do can totally change the case
NONE with regard to your second example i think there is a good case for charging voluntary manslaughter if he kill and aggrivated assault or assault with a deadly weapon if he just injures there are two reason for this if we treat all willful assault with a deadly weapon a murder in term of punishment there is no reason for an assailant to stop short of killing the moment the knife puncture the skin you re facing life in prison might a well kill him to make sure he ca nt testify against you it s actually very hard to determine what would be the consequence of an action other than the consequence that actually took place the example of the gun to the head misfiring is an extreme case but most case are nt like that say someone is driving drunk at a low speed is that chargeable a manslaughter certainly if they actually kill someone but in reality it s not very likely that a lowspeed driver is going to kill someone even if they do cause a crash again this raise the point of incentivizing mitigating behavior we actually want the drunk driver to drive more slowly even if we would prefer she did nt drive at all
AH nothing you have to say ha any value check that ego later

NONE exactly there s never any reason a person should be forced to stay in a relationship or should nt be able to call it off when they want to but i want to hope that people are in healthy relationship where the topic of sex and boundary happens loooong before it come to fighting and having an ugly breakup because one of them just expected the other to change their moral or need
AH you re just a bigoted transphobe being pc is about treating others with respect and not using slur trans people are real saying otherwise is scientically wrong scream and throw tendies all you like
NONE okay but you re ignoring the larger implication of your cmv that most people who are bullied are bullied for socially acceptable trait you do nt get to ignore that in favor of your tiny reality
AH so you ll never agree that he is a ludicrously successful business man because of who his dad is he ha made stellar choice create brand new business and exploded his net worth he ha created dozen and dozen of successful business so to claim that he is nt a brilliant businessman is completely idiotic did he have a leg up sure but he certainly went above and beyond there s a reason most familial wealth only last three generation you have to actually be successful to keep it he not only kept the wealth but multiplied it more than fold most people have his inheritance at million at most i do nt know how people claim that that is easy it s not he could have taken that money and retired but instead he made an empire and is quite possibly going to be the next potus think what you will of his policy but to deny his business genius and general intelligence just make you look dumb
NONE a a general rule i think you are right though i will take issue with one part of the post your comment about zach i have a close family friend who ha down let call him paul he is fairly high functioning ha a job washing dish doe his own laundry can cook his own simple meal etc but that is about the limit of his potential he ll never even live on his own much le achieve a lot of the thing that most of u would consider standard life stuff get married have a career be a father etc if paul had had the opportunity that you describe for zach i can tell you it would have been one of the best moment of his life he would remember it until the day he died and would talk about it all the time for someone who simply ca nt achieve even the normal thing in life i do nt see the harm in giving him an experience like that so that he can feel some of the joy that others feel from success
AH tagged a a clinton shill
NONE hillary is pure evil lol
AH i m gon na quote uxudoxis here dude make a well thought out and pretty convincing argument and all you care about is that he is nt interested in wasting time arguing with someone who wo nt change their mind you re not arguing the point that are being made you re shoving the argument you want to debate down other people s throat and pretending like it wa theirs which is why i m done with you enjoy your masturbation session
NONE are they supposed to pull you aside and explain why your behavior is wrong i do nt think anyone is doing this a a favor or education i think if someone call you out on behavior in public they re doing it to publicly shame you if they re wrong they are inviting themselves up for public shaming themselves it doe not give you the right to start apparently screaming in their face or threatening them which is illegal calmly explain why they re wrong
AH sure they may never win but i would nt say they are failing if your country is a barbaric backwater slum of butchery and misery and will never be any better due to a permanent state of war you have lost you have lost so utterly and completely that i am frankly horrified that you do nt understand the current state of reality over there no seriously that is horrifying that you are so ignorant and dismissive about this you really would behave like that just for the sake of arguing some silly little bullshit thread on reddit
NONE a both an animal defender and a meat eater and though i agree about the hypocrisy i can only say that this attempt at shaming is futile i ve only come off meat after witnessing farmed animal suffering for the nth time and tbh my main realization wa that i did nt want to fund the people who were responsible for these horrendous treatment so yes it s hypocritical but saying it is nt going to open anybody s eye and calling someone a hypocrite upfront may not be the best way to invite them into a realm of new idea ignorance is nt always a choice
AH you re making shitty argument against shitty cherry picked argument do something more constructive with your time
NONE how about instead we hate all pedophile and you sickos stop trying to normalize pedophilia you re all disgusting

NONE i think since we have gender neutral word now we should use them huh
AH great contribution to the conversation way to eloquently refute my argument while simultaneously providing justification or evidence for your own oh you did nt do that you did nt even single out one point i made that you disagree with your first reaction to someone who ha a different perspective than you is to insult them instead of living up to the spirit of the subreddit and engage in an open and honest debate you d rather directly violate the comment rule enjoy being reported for violation of rule
NONE i understand your argument and fully support your point of view my only point is that i m under the impression that reddit want to create an open platform while attempting to maintain this openness they support many disagreeable people idea etc they only want to moderateban when it s breaking the law or violating one of their few rule mostly reflecting their argument here http wwwredditblogcomeverymanisresponsibleforhisownhtml i m not agreeing or disagreeing just pointing out what i understand reddit s current stance to be
AH a healthy diet being necessary to the the health of the state the right of the people to grow their own food shall not be infringed while you do nt have to eat healthy your right shall not be infringed one must understand grammar and the english language to understand the nd amendment
NONE it might make you a horrible person but it is self consistent the idea is people should be forced to have child they conceive a life is sacred or something the child should have a high standard of living which you should provide at the cost of your own happiness not money from the state

AH every word is made up if you want to communicate like a civilized person you learn language and made up word there is nothing different about the word cisgender ci is a latin prefix if you did nt know english ha a lot of borrowed latin prefix by all mean remain willfully ignorant that s your decision albeit an incredibly ignorant and stupid one
NONE you can phrase it many way such a the greatest thing you ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return or be excellent to each other or be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle but trite a it sound there is meaning in realizing that life can be short and hard but it is better if we ease each other s way through life this is why you see that theme repeated in almost any culture
AH that s not what i m saying come up with a counterargument that doe nt rely on putting word in my mouth then tell me what the fuck you re saying do nt make me ask a third time i m not saying we ban anything including campaign contribution i m saying that having corporation be able to spend money on campaign doe not make the world a better place it make the world a better place by being an alternative to your arbitrary ageist and illegal proposal label which you have yet to deny or argue against the broken window fallacy is about the creation of good building a new window etc and the stimulation of the economy work for work s sake is not an economic benefit great now explain to me doe all tv and film production count a work for work s sake or are you just gullible enough to trust a judge to figure out what medium s valuable and what is nt censoring accordingly do you think the human who form corporation should have the right to not be the property of someone else or a group of others no but my objection to the th amendment have fuck all to do with this topic
NONE everything you said make sense and i agree with it argument that convince other people that i do nt agree with could include the status quo up here in oilberta million of people rely on the oil industry in some way or other for their livelihood and if you wanted to develop a cleaner better energy source they d resist any change that take away from their living political pressure pretend you re an elected official and i sponsored your campaign last time around gee it would sure be a shame if i sponsored your rival oilguzzler if you did nt support some bill that i wa a fan of would nt it erosion of the concept of scientific consensus fundamentalist who water down the idea of what a scientific theory is and is nt with regard to geology and biology in particular can often influence the public to the point where they simply do nt believe there s any climate change whatsoever and if they ve completely invalidated that a a possibility then the whatif scenario you describe is way too easy for them to ignore
AH dam it s kind of sad nobody ha posted the real answer so far i wo nt think it s because of lazy fat people i am one of you it must be because all the post and karma point come from people who do nt need to go to the gym i imaginehope it s because everyone here so far is blessed with a naturally high metabolism and do nt need to work out i m a lifelong gym guy but not because i m a stud gym rat bro it s because i fight my weight all throughout my life it fluctuates i have time i m a fucking stud there are month where i wo nt want to take picture it s because asshole sit and fuck around texting wasting time n machine that people need to use at first i wa nt a cock but fuck the amount of time i ve wasted precious time waiting for some fucking idiot playing with his phone and when i hit this cuntof allcunts up and say hey how many set do you have left or you still using that and they reply i got whatever many set left if you still do nt get it and i do nt mean you op i m speaking to the void of cunt that do this it s hard enough to regulate time to force myself to go to the gym do your set and kick rock you fucking dumb stupid narcissistic cunt or something a bit more civilized

NONE maybe people do nt want to bother their friend with discussing the death of a loved one maybe they feel uncomfortable burdening friend with such topic and photograph maybe the rest of their friendsfamily are a wreck and they feel like they have to be strong so an anonymous internet community is the best place for them to come to term with the death maybe they do nt even have anyone to share thought and feeling with i do nt like it either but who the hell are we to judge and discredit someone s grieving process therefore i just ignore it and move along
AH yeah yeah we all have our threshold for calling out bullshit when you started confidently saying stuff that wa really really wrong i realized your whole framework for contextualizing anything i wa going to tell you wa so full of hole that this may be le of any issue of needing to point out a few citation and more of an issue of you needing someone to tell you that you are full of shit that you really should nt honestly have an opinion on any of this but i could be wrong about that approach cheer
NONE i read through your answer and pretty much all of what you said wa answered with i do nt preach tolerance that wa the value i wa getting at because that seemed to be one of the big one that are being pushed for in today s group and organization you having a completely different value system than what i expected tbh a lot of what people believe is based on their value and changing a person value is one of the hardest thing to do so i m not going to waste my time trying to but at least i got to hear from a the pov of a view i did nt know about so thanks for that
AH i m talking about the black life matter organization then maybe you should actually look into that organization instead of propagating the propaganda of racist you can read more here because it seems like you have nt read much into it good job you ve made me mad because that s insulting a fuck i ve marched with blm actually gon na do it again pointing to one dipshit a though she represents me my girlfriend and my friend and accusing me of ignorance is downright fucking insulting of you fucking really you re gon na point to some nameless nameless that shitteir article from that clickbait rag doe nt even fucking know her name but dare to call her a fucking leader dipshit with a megaphone and say she represents me say she represents my black friend that want life free from fear of police brutality because some fucking anonymous woman said some stupid shit you re going to say the entirety of blm want segregation no i m a white man dating a black woman and we both openly support blm say it to me right fucking here tell me that she and i want segregation
NONE so why is the rape fantasy prevalent in our society sorry to split my point but i had a couple more thought later first if a woman is enjoying the idea of being taken by force then it s not nonconsensual is it if in her fantasy mind you it s something that she want then it s not rape it s consensual rape roleplay between her and her fantasy not quite the same thing but to get more to the why about it if the rape fantasy is a result of woman evolving to want or enjoy rape why do men have rapevictim fantasy i could nt find any statistic but a cursory search indicates that it happens both in out gay men and in straight dude to me that lean away from the idea that it is something particular to woman and more importantly to me a a straight dude who doe nt have fantasy of getting gayraped i m just guessing you are stop me if i m wrong there how would you feel if someone cited the fact that straight guy sometimes fantasize about gay rape and used that to imply that somehow all straight guy a a class including you wanted to be raped by a dude
AH this is nt your cmv you stupid motherfucker stay the hell out of this thread no one care about your dumb fucking opinion here you piece of stupid interrupting shit

NONE you posted an argument and gave solid proof to back it up it also doe nt help that i agree with you on all these point however due to the nature of this sub i will attempt to change your view college should nt be free because rich people will become slightly le rich there s my argument it s not a good argument but it is one godspeed my friend
AH speaking of amputee why doe god hate them it seems faith healer can cure cancer depression and a host of other ailment but ca nt seem to cure amputee the omnipotent seems impotent wow with noel cowardesque wit like that you must be a hit at party what issue of the new yorker did you steal that from if you honestly need someone to explain to you the difference between jesus preforming miracle and some creep in a white suit ripping off the gullible and the stupid then you have no business in this conversation
NONE why be good when you can be great why not set your life up a an example for your child to follow do you want your child to accomplish great thing or simply get through life being unnoticed why would you ever choose to strive for mediocracy sure the pain of loss is real and it hurt but how doe that compare to looking back at someone s life and realizing what they missed out on because they wanted to avoid pain “ of all sad word of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been ”
AH maybe if i type like you you can understand me bring some proof or you look ignorant tell me how i m wrong all you ve done is say you re wrong with no reasoning that s not proof either that or run away it up to you the definition i bring up are nt out of context in fact they re entirely in context of this discussion if you used the link i sent you you d know that you havent proven you know anything about the law since you have nt cited any actual law or case reasoning just saying
NONE alright i do nt have a lot more to say but my final point would be to repeat my thing about evidence before theory if the interpretation disagree about the correct interpretation of the law supposing the originalist version to be correct and then using that a proof that originalism is correct is circular i do nt think that s what you meant though you ve addressed other thing like that elsewhere so i do nt think it s actually a big point hopefully i ve been helpful anyway
AH choosing to protest this weekend doe not prevent liberal from also doing what the op proposes it s not a semantic argument it s questioning why it s assumed both ca nt happen also funny to see you say to change ops mind or get off cmv when you do nt seem to be trying to change ops mind either nor have you changed anyone s mind on this subreddit delta should nt you be getting off cmv
NONE this ha nothing to do with respect this is about protecting you from potentially poor choice in friendsmatesemployeesteammateswhatever the idea is to not judge people by their outside because usually that wo nt reflect who they really are likewise if others judge me i should have the right to judge others respectfully who the hell care is this retribution to you just because somebody ha a bad policy doe nt mean you should copy it
AH translation my crazy fringe belief are unsupported by any evidence on the face of this planet but i do nt understand why everyone doe nt see why everyone is disregarding modern scholarship on the topic to follow my fringe belief

AH no you really really do nt i do nt care if you ve been there you are like the ascetic who say i know what it mean to want material thing i used to be like that then everything wa stolen from me and i found happiness in this monastery but trust me material and interpersonal relationship of this world are fake and meaningless so if a man discovers that he is homosexual is he entitled to go to straight men and say hey i used to have sex with girl but let me tell you sex with guy is ten time better so what s your point just because we would ve agreed at one point it doe nt mean what you re saying now ha any validity you ve been cheated on so in your mind there ca nt be people who go through life happy with one partner it s misleading it s very nice however it s possessive and a bad foundation for a relationship contract oh nice to hear that my love and emotion are fake and bad for me i wonder if it s possible that you re actually aware of how arrogant and bullheaded you are
NONE people would nt post on reddit saying they were suicidal if they were truly set on doing it it s obviously a cry for help which yes is a form of attentionseeking but i think it s an acceptable one and here s why have you ever been upset about something and had someone talk to you about it and the person doe nt tell you anything you had nt already considered but yet talking to them help it reaffirms that you re not crazy for thinking those thing that other people agree with you and also that other people care enough about you to try to help you someone who is suicidally depressed probably ha nt heard that from anyone in a long time to hear from anyone even a complete stranger on the internet that their emotion matter to someone to have someone take the time to type the word you are loved please do nt do this can work wonder and yeah it s attention that sustained you but a long a you do nt make a habit of it and become someone who can only be okay if others are paying them enough attention it s okay to ask for help

AH if your hypothetical scenario is being used to extrapolate idea for real human but you are nt dealing with real human it s useless bullshit you might a well be using a hypothetical population of dog it s not useful constructive scientific or really even worth arguing but seeing how this post is filled with ad hominem i do nt know why i m even surprised anymore i do nt really give a flying fuck if you think i downvoted you on the other hand i do kind of care about you calling me a man fuck off i m a woman i got downvotes which i m not going to blame you for just because i do nt like your argument i m not going to be a baby about them and you could definitely have made this conversation matter if you had even vaguely tried
NONE sure i mean yeah this guy sound like a jerk and this is probably not a good situation but i just do nt think this risk of emotional harm outweighs these other issue there is some critical mass for these thing if there wa an engagement or upcoming wedding thing would be different but with just the fact you ve presented i do nt think we can be confident and say there is a clear right and moral decision here because there s a lot we do nt know pulling away from the abstract i do nt think you should advice your friend strongly either way this guy is probably best avoided but i think you might put your friend in a bad spot be pressing her to tell the girl there are also safety implication what if the girlfriend come after your friend
AH maybe the problem here is that you re a bigot
NONE suffice it to say you re idea is more your
AH maybe you re the asshole for assuming everyone who doe something wrong is an asshole
NONE i think you re right unless the raper is into girl dressing like pioneer or something
AH dude i know you re trying to be the good liberal and prove whatever the fuck it is your trying to prove but my original statement still stand and it wa nt that i do nt find black people attractive i do nt find really fucking dark people attractive jesus dude
NONE so if i create the same online profile and one feature a hot guy and the other guy is ugly if look really did nt matter they would have the same number of message if look really do nt matter than all thing being the same both profile should get the same response but we know they do nt
AH and when you turn what will your view be then some of u have to grow up and face the real world if you want to go live in somalia where you can do whatever you want and not pay tax if you are strong enough to resist the warlord then be our guest but until you re ready to go out there and create this utopia you want quit griping about the system we have from your mom s basement
NONE i mean that s the crux of the matter right how much you are willing to give up to keep your hand clean and that depends on how bad the crime you are complicit in are even though my family would not be broke if we moved to canada or switzerland i do nt think the crime the u is committing are bad enough to justify leaving the country one day they could be and if that day come i will leave
AH haha i do nt hold individual men responsible for toxic masculinity lmao this response is so hilarious afroninity you re basically comedy gold haha i m not going to deal with most of your response but i m not a hypocrite there are nt biological difference that explain the wage gap lol men are stronger than woman that explains the violence thing there are few high paying job that require physical strength different but equal is a valid position to hold learn to logic
NONE the response you are going to get however wrong they are are that coercion is necessary because without it no one would ever hire minority this of course is nt true but people do nt want to consider the nuance of the thing you ve said it s easier for them to just say you have fewer black people than i think you should therefore it s clearly racism it s the easy way out for them trying to force a result rather than addressing the root cause of how those number worked out that way in the first place
AH what i never claimed or agreed that men play a better quality more exciting game i think it is boring to see one serve after another whiz past the other whether it s for an ace or a fault the woman s game is far superior how can you be sure the medium is nt doing what it always doe telling you how to think and feel oh but no you are too smart for that are nt you you are free are nt you except of course for the govmnt they re the only one with force i do nt know how the typical white male can get any stupider
NONE often the question are nt all about what is being asked in the text but in the subtext in your example what they are trying to get at is are you the sort of person who will build yourself up to feel accomplished or tear others down for the same feeling which they ca nt ask just like that because that make the right choice obvious by making both choice feel kind of shitty they re trying to make you think about it and in doing so get at the heart of your actual character and they re more effective at it than you might think
AH because op is a lonely angry little man
NONE he is a dangerous faggot a said by him
AH if you think hillary clinton is evil or corrupt then there is most likely nothing factual anyone can say to change your mind a you most likely lack the intelligence or reasoning ability to be politically informed in the first place
NONE what if one of the objective moral fact is that it is immoral to search for objective moral fact or even to continue living this sort of thing doe nt seem to be any more or le likely than that any of our moral intuition would be near to objective moral truth
AH prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one s own race is superior the second definition just go on to further explain the first it say each race that would mean one would have to be inferior if another wa superior read it more closely next time before you start insulting people i ll help explain it to you i know english can get a tiny bit complicated the belief that all member of each race posse characteristic ability or quality specific to that race especially so a to distinguish it a inferior or superior to another race or races from a racist white person s perspective all member of the black race posse quality so a to distinguish it a inferiorsuperior to another raceraces your desperation to stick the word racism on everyone in the conversation is making you see thing racism is nt a ubiquitous a you make it sound you make it sound so easy to slip into racism somehow if it wa you would certainly be racist
NONE i think it s more that when person a say something that person b belief to be bigoted b calling a a bigot destroys productive conversation when an argument or belief is ignored and we proceed to shame someone until they either leave or are coerced into a superficial change we have fundamentally failed to address whatever produced the bigoted behavior do that with enough of them for long enough and they ll find each other and start having conversation among themselves with little or no moderating influence so they re not around you but what they believe and do get progressively worse take cmv i have never ever seen a racist person change their view in response to righteous indignation and shame more often than not they do nt think their view is racist and they view being called a bigot for what it is a signal that the substantive discussion is over and the tarring and feathering ha begun the heel dig in and the rest is a shitshow the only thing that have a chance of working are tolerance and patience so while it might not be equally bad it is making the problem worse
AH http wwwgooglecouksearch qtrumpshouldbeassasinated ieutf oeutf clientfirefoxb gferdcr eigcgwlywkawkqfwew qtrumpshouldbeassassinated i did not say of all article exclusively ask for him to be killed you idiot why have you left out the next part punched or smear campaign of course that doe not fit your fake strawman narrative

AH ∆ i have taken it upon myself to issue you this mighty delta a op wa a dick today and quoted his delta may it serve you well
NONE i came here wishing that someone had changed your mind because i desperately need my mind to be changed on the same topic
AH i m saying that many who ca nt call their a spade a spade are likely digging their own grave that doe not give you any insight into my empathy no but the callous nature of your post on this topic are clearly a strong indicator of your position and willingness to empathize with position outside of your own regarding the topic at hand multiple time your point wa essentially i ca nt see why it would be like that and i regularly pressed you to consider it from a different perspective this whole thing completely ignores the fact that i m mostly talking about lower to middle class family that believe their life is a hard a you say it is for people in actually terrible environment which is fine but we re also talking about the low class and impoverished because the op is a blanket statement blanket statement are most easily refuted on the fact that they are not if op wanted to change his pov to one of it s an indication of poor parenting that would be fine but obese kid automatically bad parent is flat out wrong and all it take is one example to prove that to be so at this point we re both playing devil s advocate for a fairly small portion of parent with fat child the fringe population where they ca nt do much more but they are nt doing enough yup because there is nt much more to be argued for in favor of people with the way and mean to provide but neglecting to do so sometimes obesity is nt out of neglect and that ha to be accounted for in blanket statement ya fucking happy
NONE i think you re making a fairly arbitrary and somewhat useless distinction between lying and telling selective truth first of all if you talked to any adult the way you re describing and they found out the full truth later they would absolutely accuse you of lying to them and you d have to be very pedantic to claim otherwise if you see the utility of telling selective truth i do nt know why you think it s any different with untruth the result is exactly the same the child ha an inaccurate idea of something in their mind but it s a functional useful inaccuracy that can be fixed later how are significant omission and major simplification any different from lie in practice there are also many lie which are such strong social convention that you risk greater harm and embarrassment to the child from telling them the truth than from simply lying santa is a good example a kid is a lot more likely to end up in an uncomfortable situation if told santa is nt real from a very young age than if allowed to believe in the myth for a few year i also think you underestimate the persistence of child s curiosity a simple conversationending lie can resolve thing very neatly to everyone s benefit that s why efficient standardissue lie have developed around sticky subject like where do baby come from that s a much harder subject to handle if you try to tell the truth a threeyearold can ask why forever and what s the benefit you re never going to get to a point where anything resembling the real truth exists in the child s mind it s inherently impossible
AH no i really did mean what i wrote if you want to take my word and twist them to mean the exact opposite of what i said please do nt waste either of our time
NONE i m not really here to change your view only to point out that a number of his pick for position of power have been well interesting other than that what do you think of sander
AH nobody ha refuted a single thing the only two argument presented against me are men deserve a faster line men can not be trusted around woman if that is all you ve got from these post then your reading comprehension suck even more than your rethorical skill
NONE be used a the cornerstone of an argument not if you are talking about it a a cornerstone of the wage gap discussion it is however a valid concern on a personal level everyone know sexist i know a lot of woman who s boss do think le of them because they are woman
AH unless you think it did nt do that and if you do i do nt know what to tell you what you re telling me is that you do nt bother with fact citizen united stuck down part of the campaign reform act prior to that act the donation you speak of were perfectly legal so unless you think that wa some glorious period of corruption free election you re full of shit trump directly attacked the qualification of a judge simply because that judge did nt do what he wanted so again obama attack a judge for not doing what he want that s fine trump doe is and it s evil yeah that s definitely not a double standard
NONE but we do nt have many in story agreed upon fact you ve listed of them but even those do nt paint a good enough picture that we can definitively say x did it i just reread something you said and i want to put forth an alternative option it just doe nt make sense that he would beat her unless he thought it wa her making the advance which he could have only known if he wa watching them for a period of time what if mayella admitted to it bob come in tom run out then bob say what the hell happened here did he rape you and she said no i kissed him is nt that possible given the fact that we know
AH a i said earlier it a hell of a ride from start to finish you have astounded me with your kek given unique insight i m sure some day you will win the god emperor s favor and just maybe you can serve a his humble as wiper you remind me a bit of a recently escaped north korean guy i met once struggling to come to term with a non north korean reality it really interesting to see the similarity and cult like behavior it s fascinating
NONE it is true that we re more likely but we re still very polarised in region like scotland there s a deep running hatred of the tory party he say he want challenged but a man who give false evidence to back up his claim doe not want challenged in my opinion he would need to be open minded towards it being changed to want it changed and thank you i think to give a delta you just copy and paste the wee triangle on the right
AH so do nt buy one if you want to take mine away you can try but you would not survive the attempt typical ammosexual comment keep an eye on your kid and loved one you are stupidly putting them at risk of an early violent death so speaks the surgeon general
NONE ah ok then here is my new point why not assume that they are going to be uncomfortable let the dog into the yard and then ask if you can bring them in that way you avoid anyone being unnecessarily uncomfortable if you do nt already know their preference and if they are okay with dog you can let them back in
AH we know the wall is nt practical how on earth is it not practical it will solve a huge domestic issue and mexico is nt going to pay for it no matter how much trump insists that they will sigh how uneducated and ignorant can people truly get he literally ha a detailed plan on how he will get mexico to pay for it but people like you are so biased and so far left you do nt give a shit to actually read up about all the candidate so take a minute and please go educate yourself
NONE i hear what you re saying but i think that maybe you are just the unicorn sexual crime can create huge trust issue for an individual particularly if the person who did it wa an authority figure people can get over it and survive it but that doe not mean that it did not leave huge lasting scar on them to say that it is emotional weakness is maybe just a way for you to be able to move on from your own experience it put power back into your court many people cope differently
AH it actually is a word http wwwdefinitionoforgdisattach sorry you re so obsessed with correcting people that you do nt realize that the entire point of a language is that it ha variety i mean we d have no wordplay at all if people could nt make up word get out of your as
NONE hahaha true enough i think we can agree though that the serial comma doe not confuse people know the language any le than people new to it edit δ i forgot i wa on cmv grammatical mistake can matter to others more than they do to me and for nonpedantic reason
AH eh ive got better shit to do than explain rap music to a bunch of whitey dismiss what i say if you want not like i care about your chemical anyways
NONE i agree with you on everything except that i dont think non studied drug should be illegal until studied i think it make more sense for it to be the opposite
AH and i think this is a failing to the justice system so you think because the law hold people responsible for someone s death should that person punch someone to death our justice system is failing i wa almost taking you seriously think about your example you say both puncher are doing the exact same thing is that realistic if they did the exact same thing would nt you get the same result in real life every case is different obviously one of the puncher hit the dead guy in just the right spot and killed him and the other puncher did nt i m touched by your sympathy for the guy who killed someone but it s also suck to be killed people who punch people are assuming lot of risk like getting beat up getting in trouble even death and under the law you are assuming that risk if you choose to punch someone and you should know that because the fact you may not doe nt mean shit and you think you hate the law over this dumb shit go wiki felony murder
NONE okay point taken but how doe taking offense fix something like that offense is such a strange thing to have you saw something on tv you did nt like how about manson in the so you got offended you did nt like something personally you did nt like something personally look give me an example where taking offense solved anything not an example where someone s right were being denied you re not taking offense to that you re seeing that and understanding that is not an okay thing to do i m seeing offense a something that s personal to one person and only to that one person it s thing like swearing that people get offended by or for the more religiously inclined they feel offended when someone say that their god is a fallacy or maybe an immigrant who overheard someone badmouthing about him these are instance where simply not caring is the solution because it doe nt matter what those people think because your a big enough person to understand that those people who dislike you are not a part of your life and should nt be
AH being new to this sub is nt what should make you realize this is a played out topic having an awareness around you and common sense regarding the fact that people are in fact people just like you so obviously this topic ha been done to death common sense should tell you
NONE i think we truly start to test how strongly some people believe in the individual and lack of government interferenceregulation here if we are being intellectually honest is there anything that adult of sound mind and body should nt be able to engage in assuming no one else get hurt
AH seems awfully arrogant of you to believe that only the people who think like you are worthy of being a role model
NONE i agree but a big part of why i think people tend not to go for people considered conventionally attractive is the social stigma everyone want a trophy to show their worth
AH yeah maybe sign up for some class on logic
NONE but where do i sign up for the hooker stamp
AH well that s good maybe next time support your bullshit statement i do nt care who the fuck you are and neither doe anyone else so we should nt be expected to just take your word for it when you make bullshit accusation you hold everyone else to a standard of scrutiny that you never seem to apply to yourself
NONE he can demonize it all he want but he is not censoring it by any mean i could start a campaign to get people to never read your comment but i am not censoring you a you will be allowed to say whatever you want we just wont listen that wa just an example you have your right to comment against me and i wont attempt to take that from you trump is not trying to restrict the medium not would i be trying to restrict you it is more of a call to disregard than anything else
AH oh good maybe this conversation is nt pointless after all i think you re an actual asshole but if troll it take smooth work to rustle me when i m in this sub and actively trying to be nice
NONE you re very welcome and i enjoyed this conversation so thank you it seems like your view ha been changed or at least altered a little and i am glad that i got to be a part of that have fun my friend
AH if you do nt tell people you are a hateful bigot it is rape so how many people have you raped in your life
NONE except it s not corruption everything i ve said can arise from people doing what they sincerely believe is right
AH look at this fuckyournarrative profile he is a bully and a troll dont get sucked in
NONE ca nt do it she is corrupt and a liar she is totally unfit to be the president
AH if you are saying i actively chose to go through puberty you are wrong about me and likely of the population of the u we did nt make an active choice because we did nt even think there was a choice no you fucking idiot im saying that for a child that ha expressed that they are trans and would like to transition that going through a normal puberty rather than transition is a choice one with serious permanent consequence that in almost of case will cause them suffering for the rest of their life are you serious how the fuck do you think i wa talking about you and other ci child this entire conversation is about trans kid who have already decided theyre trans im fucking done im not reading any more of your reply because youre either colossally stupid or are deliberately not listening to the very simple and obvious point i ve made like three time now because youre just a massive transphobe and have no interest in having your view changed fuck off
NONE i m sorry you feel that way but i feel like your experience being very limited is nt a good representation of the culture a a whole i also think you re making the mistake of thinking that some of these experience did nt also happen to woman before now some men still treated woman a sex object and are just a shitty a they are now i think the biggest difference is that there s le of a societal pressure to look at the woman and make them feel like shit for sleeping with womanizer and now woman can be open about it and get support from other men and woman to help them cope and understand their experience in the old day people would jus look at you and think who give a shit that s what you get for being a whore it s different these day i think the main point you re missing is that a sexual liberation doe nt mean that you still are nt responsible for your choice or have to deal with the consequence but that you do nt have to be publicly shamed for them
AH see i already had my speech today so i got everything i wanted from here since i do nt take internet so seriously i could nt give a flying you know what about any delta i gave that thing yesterday to the first guy that had any valuable contribution if that s not enough for you pal hey cry me a river i gave a second one now just to appease you to the first guy though
NONE i think you re right that at the wedding i do nt expect to get much face time with the bride and groom nor do i expect to be thanked for my gift while i m there because again they have nt even opened it hell i just put it on a table they do nt even know i brought a gift but later i always appreciate getting a card to say that they opened my gift and enjoyed it considering the cost of a wedding the cost of a few thank you card and stamp is basically zero
AH yeah looking into the completely unfounded claim of internet stranger is nt high on my todo list today or any day unconvincing
NONE it is none of your business you should not even have an opinion on it no more so than you should have an opinion on the right of honey ant
AH the above cocksucker is a moron who want russia to reign the world over do nt sweat his bullshit
NONE the ewoks view him a a god and they took down the empire po doe nt need to fight his army can do it for him
AH you re an idiot and i will not dignify that with a response you think you know my religion better than me
NONE ooo ok sorry for questioning you i thought that you were saying i did not change your view if someone change your view even a little you should award a delta
AH lol i have taken more genetics course and done more research on the topic than i care to know while in pursuit of my medical doctorate but i m sure your wikipedia search have made you far more informed on the topic than i i am not going to bother arguing with you over concept you clearly do nt understand
NONE i ve given you stats and argument i ca nt argue your lived experience what exactly are you looking for i ve suggested catholic a a group which share the idea of monogamy i ve pointed out that educated well off people have increased survivability of offspring do you have any evidence that your proposed strategy beat mine
AH you are so ignorant nobody go against the law of thermodynamics if people dont gain weight they are not eating a surplus plain and simple how are people so stupid you dont lose weight it mean you re not eating under you tdee
NONE sometimes you really ca nt put your finger on a simple straightforward word uhh what wa that word it s not quite angry it s like kinda suppressed uh fuck it s on the tip of my tongue angry synonym bitter that wa it
AH oh look it s one of the people that pretend there wa nothing wrong at all
NONE no it doe nt i wa nt aware that this wa an intrinsic part of your view
AH your reading comprehension is unfathomably bad and your ability to do basic google search even worse thanks for helping me out i do nt know how to use google very well or read my bad let me help you out with some math i know which is why i said that the grand majority of people who qualify for wic are nt doing it based on the k number they re qualifying based on the k did it confuse you that i rounded instead of stating k or higher number you do realize that the per person amount is drastically le if you split that among among more and more people you can choose a higher amount to prove your point but now we are talking about or more people a tax credit is not the same a welfare and fpl is a cap that ha nothing to do with what we are talking about i did nt say k wa above poor i said k three time at least and no the average person making or k ha nowhere near k in stock if you think they do help me out by googling that please
NONE eh for what it s worth i do agree with your position just playing devil s advocate e i m just gon na edit here and done for the night hope you see it when it come down to it you re right in a few area no one know how to spend my money better than i do and so i should get cash so i can maximize utility and getting for gas doe nt mean i wont spend money on bad stuff it just mean i ll spend the money i would have otherwise spent on gas not to mention you can effectively sell your food stamp at a loss compared to straight cash noncash transfer do shape consumption to some degree a indicated by a few of the paper above and there may be thing that we want to steer consumption towards for the betterment of everyone then there s also the fact that those who receive the benefit of snap are nt always the same a those making the consumption choice family so if i had no input on what wa spent on by someone else a parent that is one way of ensuring that my consumption choice are taken into consideration
AH you too broseph allessi
NONE you re absolutely right
AH so now you re just being purposefully obtuse or you re not very bright i m assuming the former because you d have to be very dull indeed the game allows the player to murder npc sex worker therefore the game is sexist this is the argument i removed the stuff anita did nt actually mention ie the ability to kill literally anyone you want to kill
NONE well i do nt think you can be arrested for something you did back when it wa legal maybe not currently but the point is that a hypothetical future government is certainly capable of making it possible to arrest someone for something they did in the past when it wa legal they can literally do whatever they want which is why it s our job to protect our right and freedom
AH day after a total massacre and you are attacking the unbeliever already i see you i see your sympathy for the radical i see your tie to the muslim brotherhood i see you cursing the unbeliever i see your individual jihad and i see your tadiyah you are terrible at this the real truth about muslim immigration in to the west is you are not worth the trouble that come with you
NONE you are attempting to find consistency in a holy book you wo nt find it furthermore there are a multitude of other story in the bible that refute any claim to god being omniscient the story of adam and eve is just the first so while i m not trying to change your core view i think that basing your view on just one story is incorrect when you have so many more available
AH are you going to add anything to this conversation or just rant about liberal it look like you are stalking me in multiple thread now i did nt know i wa that important to you
NONE i did nt change it i elaborated on it i should have done so in the original post though i ll add it now if you re adding then you re changing therefore i d like a delta please
AH no the problem is you have le than a child s reading comprehension literally everything in your post demonstrates it gamergate doe indeed have nothing to do with this i never said they did what i did do wa equate your apparent understanding of free speech to gg s understanding of free speech ie they re both wrong in my mind the people who simply ask for people to not mock their religion just because they can is akin to making a request you know the very fucking thing you said mean it s important to yell no fuck you at them for asking cartoonist to not mock their religion now let s see how you misunderstand this
NONE now we re just back at your op there is a lot of content here that you ignored yes you do think it come with insult because that is immediately what you tried to put into my mouth when i said what you wanted to do wa punishment now you ve shrunk your position to not wishing to punish child at all but punishing them with poor intention or poorly executed for instance not allowing your child to go out and play until they make their bed is a punishment it s an unnatural negative consequence to not making their bed it doe nt have to be coupled with any of the story telling you re doing to make it seem questionable
AH and you are free to go to euro shit head libtard land of taxation of control i dont owe you or this so called society a god damn thing and i am free to do whatever the fuck i want so long a it is not harming or using force on anyone freedom trump all your bullshit greater good garbage and fuck your social contract ill smoke a much fucking weed and there is not a god damn thing you worthless statist can do about it
NONE virginity is nt a big deal because sex is nt a big deal it s just ignorant social bullshit that should be ignored like racist view or misogyny year ago if you said some racist bullshit people would nt bat an eye at your ignorance because to them that would be normal now if you make sex or virginity into a big deal that s just a ignorant but society is still stupid in that respect but that doe nt mean it should matter to you
AH jesus dude no have you completely ignored everything i ve said no sex should not be like a movie do nt be an idiot and no it s not okay to have sex with kid stop saying it is see what i did there my entire point is that drunk should legally be able to give informed consent people do nt choose to be kid nor do they choose to be retarded people do choose to be drunk though and they should nt be able to pas burden onto others just because they want to get drunk they should still be held responsible for their action
NONE your argument could be rephrased a i get that they want to be equal and i m find with them having equal right i just do nt want to admit that they re equal you can say two half or three third but either way it still come out to the same thing and there s no valid reason to deny that people do nt want to give up the word marriage because they think it s special and reserved just for them and that by letting gay marry they d be tarnishing the word a long a those attitude exist they cant be equal
AH if it s implied what op meant and perfectly clear to everyone but this guy no delta need awarded otherwise every single thread in this sub would need delta awarded maybe in an alternate reality abortion mean you get born anyway just without the mother having to carry you and also every time an abortion happens a million people get food and water for a year technically abortion would nt be immoral under those rule a there is no negative delta no because that s retarded you re being retarded
NONE i ve met people who are both sexpositive and antiabortion they do nt actively fight against it but they do think that abortion is unethical due to the following argument if it s not okay to kill a baby but it is okay to kill a fetus then there must be a time where it go from okay to not okay a such a time doe not exist it s ethically wrong to terminate a pregnancy please do nt debate this point with me i m not arguing it i m just presenting it a something i ve heard many time over the year
AH this is just so damn dumb i got a bit stupider reading it an opinion is a view or judgment that a person hold about something if it is possible for two people to have differing view about something a is obviously possible in many case where something is alleged to be racist how can you possibly think that it s not an opinion to think that it is or that it is not racist
NONE so your argument is there is nt so much racism against asian people so it s probably not racism and your argument is there is racism against asian so it wa probably racism your argument is just a weak if you want to claim it wa racism that wa the deciding factor then provide evidence that that s the case otherwise your argument hold no intellectual water so to speak
AH no but we can be reasonably sure alito wa likely no fan of his policy or his administration and would have ruled in a similar manner if you had any proof then you might have an argument but you do nt because it s not about having a bias it s about having a bias that s going to effect their ability to properly do their job you really think rbg would have sided with trump on some issue only to flip just because of her opinion on him you really think she d have come up with a different vote on a trump eo than any other conservative president i have reason to suspect this yes yes absolutely these are judge that side with killer and child rapist when necessary to uphold the best interest of the law doing their job even though they think one of the party is a douchebag not only doe nt rise to the point of recuseal it s probably not even rare for them i ll give you the benefit of the doubt and say it s your liberal bias and not stupidity that leaf you to believe this
NONE i think if people were willing to evaluate every single year old who wanted to vote we d find lot of them that are totally qualified but it would take way to long to determine this voting is nt a very tedious process the government doe nt have any criterion for who can vote but they ca nt have actual child voting so they ve got to pick somewhere to draw the line basically you re right in theory but it would never work in practice however with criminal you re already having a trial for every single person it s extremely tedious but we do it because it s important to make sure people do nt get excessively or in this case inexcessively punished so that s why this is the one area of the law that is flexible because we can actually look at each case individually and decide if the person s age had anything to do with it also it doe nt sound like you re questioning the logic of it but if you are the line of thinking is that a year old know just a well a an year old not to rape someone being young and inexperienced doe nt excuse violence
AH a a subreddit they did you are just lying to protect the fact that you like to be cruel to people
NONE so essentially they re doing the work necessary to support you against their will is nt that kind of like slavery
AH wow just wow you sound like an ignorant fool
NONE you think ‘ merica control the world how ignorant
AH firstly i would like to point out you brought up adoptive cuckold not me this is a cmv he wrote a very specific cmv and then even amended it in the comment you for some reason have drawn your own ridiculous scenario out of this already ridiculous scenario in the scenario given which is what i ve been talking about all along your argument is more for the societal good and ha nothing to do with the individual i argue more for the individual out of your argument i can glean you are probably also for gun control and expanded welfare program i am not therefore we will never see eye to eye and i will think you re a ridiculous liberal and you think i m some crazy conservative nothing could be further from the truth for me but you continue to argue for the societal good at the expense of the individual i personally feel that is an outlandish scapegoat argument and you re simply an idiot however everyone is entitled to their opinion just a i am entitled to my opinion that your opinion is retarded all this being said we have identified our difference me for the individual and you for the societal good you know what else is for the societal good abortion so abort that little fucker before it becomes a drain on my bank account anyway have a good day arguing for the right of the many over the individual right i ll be over here championing for individual freedom much like abortion and body autonomy
NONE i think you make a good argument and i can see where you are coming from completely just personally in my life i have gotten a lot of people to see feminism in a different and le negative light just by presenting logical argument i see that a a worthwhile effort for the reason i listed in my other comment i think rebranding is nt an option i m not comfortable with that because it seems like giving up and because the feminist movement ha so much history so much academia attached to it changing the name at this point could cause confusion you have to remember that feminist theory is an academic discipline so it s not just a political movement it s also just a matter of respect for me respect for the woman and men who came before me who fought and suffered greatly so that i can participate more fully in society i feel like we owe them a great debt and changing the name of the movement doe nt honor their memory and their sacrifice just an aside i have some male friend who call themselves profeminist instead of feminist so they support the general idea of feminism but do nt feel comfortable calling themselves feminist for various reason how would that sit with you for the men obviously we can both agree that the optimal situation is that they all would walk the walk but a it stand it would bother me that most of them would nt take the label because it s rejecting so much history so much hard work just because of a negative stereotype it doe feel like throwing the baby out with the bathwater
AH i suck at music more than you suck at basic discussion hombre you made an empirical claim that passive hobby such a music are uninteresting if you meant that a a personalised subjectivity you should have phrased a such it s incredible that you demand such specificity and seem to esteem it to the highest regard like you re some systematic savant yet you do nt communicate logically or efficiently like that absurd claim you made about burden of proof how is it that you premise your argument i challenge your premise and i have to validate my challenge before the premise ha even been defined and substantiated it s not even practical and you tried to pas it of a an implicit logical rule burden of proof can lie on whoever but conventionally it would be you of which you have none a you evidenced another logical inconsistency from the advocate of google i ve googled leftright brain related to math and art and became more learned because of it obviously you havent
NONE either you do nt understand what objective and subjective mean or i do nt just because there is nt an objectively right answer doe nt mean people ca nt try to explain why they think their answer is better that s pretty much what a subjective opinion mean i ca nt explain my preference for jpop over country music or my preference for pizza over brussel sprout everything featured on fear factor is a delicacy somewhere i think it s all subjective and therefore pointless to explain the point is that i m not going to accept an argument if it relies on a claim of something just being objectively true with no further explanation now if something is objective that mean there is some kind of an explanation because objective reasoning relies on some kind of universally observable fact or phenomenon given that objective reasoning relies on thing we all know and accept a true there should be a lot of explanation for any objective deduction and none of them would be particular to a given person and so there is every reason to talk about them
AH it is never someone s responsibility to stop someone from raping them if anyone never say okay never even make an effort to participate it is rape ragnarocker think like a rapist
NONE well all he talk about is gender a a broad term so my opinion would be if he s not actively taking a position against it he doe nt care if he doe nt care then by definition transsexualism is not sinful
AH is see you use facebook buzz feed and politifact for your information clinton is objeciveltly the worst presidential candidate since regan bengazi with holding info from the fbi defending bill rape etc edit uh oh child do not like it when their favorite candidate is mocked
NONE firstly if the lecturer wa showing something that would reasonably upset a lot of people violence abuse suicide etc then yes please put a notice at the start of a class do you not include rape in this consideration because this is pretty much all anyone want
AH anecdote are dsigned to elict emotional response and are used to try to override statistical fact no this is what anecdote mean http wwwgooglecomsearch qanecdote ieutf oeutf you dont get to use word and make up your own meaning to them i m only using u number because my position is only about u citizen if we were arguing about how many car crash happen in china ever year i would nt include crash from russia and japan are you what lmao first off that s a total false equivalency terrorist attack car accident wtf second off if you were having a conversation about how unsafe car are using stats from china or russian would be valuable data you are literally proving my point so great thank you we can now agree that islamic violence is a relevant issue whether it happens in london or in boston of course if we funded counter terror le and more attack happened i would need to revalue my opinion with the new number oh wonderful please take a moment and think about what number of innocent people dying from i dont know a nail bomb that get planted at another tween girl s concert then get back to me you do nt explain why this logic is wrong you just call it sicking without ever telling me why it is because to me they are roughly equivalent a both end up with one person dead car accident accident a cognitive choice people make very day knowing the danger of driving terrorist attack getting murdered for not believing in islam how old are you if you are over the age of holy fuck
NONE there are a lot of premise that you use to buttress your conclusion however many of them are debateable first of all it seems that your argument assumes that people would live year in the body of a yearold adult is that right anyway on to your various premise if one is immortal then you have all the time in the world to do thing but eventually i think you will run out of thing to do why there are thousand and thousand of thing to do and you wo nt get to do most of them in your life mastering every instrument feasible going to every art museum in europe possible if the art doe nt deteriorate even if people live for far long amount of time we would keep creating new thing to do for ourselves if immortality wa achieved we would have to stop having child why this thrown out without any justification we could keep having child we would just have to expand into space because there would be way more of u we may be able to have the manpower to develop megastructures like you see in sci fi movie and finally if immortality wa possible do you really think you or i would get it no the rich and powerful will have access to it maybe this point is true but your argument mainly geared towards weighing the pro and con for those who become immortal why would it bother the mortal whether or not there is immortality hitler s year reich may very well be a possibility i see you ve demonstrated godwin s law http enwikipediaorgwikigodwin slaw in your argument
AH they used that footage for demonstrative purpose are you fucking retarded where else are they supposed to find footage to use in their ad none of actual mexican flooding over the border exists so they used other footage just to illustrate their point obviously you re the same a politifact so biased you ca nt even grasp the idea of metaphoric content
NONE how is it unfair to rate those movie low you just explained how they are losing value the only people who would actually use those rating are people like you who do nt have the understanding of context required to warrant the amazingly high rating so why allow other people walk into the same situation and experience that disappointment
AH do nt bother with this clown he s one of those armchair evolutionary psychologist who make a lot of claim without any evidence just look at his reply to your post just pseudointellectual trash
NONE well a lot of this come from an inability to separate an idea from your own person look at soorts fan if you say team x suck this year many many people will take it personally
AH deleted what is this http pastebincomfcrfsk
NONE deleted what is this http pastebincomfcrfsk
AH absolutely perhaps the answer is to stop replying to my nonsense and childish behavoir
NONE i m not here to argue with you this is postmodernism at it finest and most idiotic
AH again you provided a definition that supported your argument that s it pretending there is only one definition for pain used across all of science is exactly the type of misrepresentation vegan need to rely on to try and make their shitty argument all you are is pseudoscience my b deficient friend for the umpteenth time you simply dismiss the evidence that i ve provided because you could nt live with yourself if you had to acknowledge that plant can suffer and feel distress which likely mean you have multiple other issue and for everyone s sake i hope you get the help you need
NONE i think it s just always hard to attempt to judge other people family especially when you only see them in passing in a restaurant or whatnot you can just never be sure what the situation is or the context for whatever you see i mean obviously there are certain thing that are never appropriate but within reason my personal view is that we should all just be the best parent we can be and do what seems to work for our family offering advice if others ask but trying to understand that no matter how great one thing is for one kid it may not work for another
AH okay since you re not getting it i ll spell it out nice and simple for ya yo overbooking massage is not the same a overbooking a flight the main reason is because massage and fucking airline are different industries in different industry different behavior are acceptable to customers people have no problem waiting minute for a doctor to come into the office but would not be okay with a taxi driver spending minute finishing up a text before driving what this means is that your example fucking suck because you re comparing apple and orange
NONE i agree with the idea behind this but there are some impracticality here for instance is extremely high if i m going out for a casual lunch a tip could make it quite an expensive meal i ll usually tip sometimes if it wa nt good service also how do you handle some of those in between restaurant where you do nt exactly have a server but there is a wait staff like restaurant where you go and order your food and then someone brings it out to you refill drink etc seems like there would be some kink in a mandatory system like this
AH more useless propaganda and failure to address the point
NONE this response is equally meaningless and useless to the discussion
AH are you another one who think banning a wetsuit with a hood on it is going to do anything
NONE it would be good for rap song who would be on the front got so many roosevolts i make my own new deal
AH i do nt agree with this well that s because you re a redditor who s never made any effort to research anything beyond the first page of google and a skim of a wikipedia page there are discussion among expert that have spanned for a century which you decide to flagrantly ignore in favour of forming conclusion that fit perfectly with your preconceived bias by spending a couple minute on google the dictionary doe nt summarise the ongoing discussion in entire field of study in one sentence that s a ludicrous notion to put forth you re not worth arguing with unless you actually make real attempt to critically engage with the subject http wwwdictionarycombrowsepostmodernism st this is a concept that take week of study to begin to grasp but apparently this singlesentence dictionary definition tell a layman everything they need to know til also if feminist felt the definition did nt accurately reflect their view i feel like there would be more of an effort to change it you re catching on no one care about dictionary if you cited a dictionary in an academic paper the reviewer eye would roll out of their head
NONE why do you believe so furiously in that arbitrary definition of liberty apparently you have it defined and spent a lot of time thinking about how to summarize it which is already a bit strange from your other reply it look like like your whole rationale work around this definition that s a little disconcerting because it sound like a dogma instead of defining liberty based on society s structure you define society s structure based on this particular view it seems religious that seems like a problematic approach because you ignore look up your so what comment just to fit the world in your view apparently you prefer to let real people with real problem for example not being able to choose equality which content they experience on the internet to change your view about some ideal that mean anything in reality do nt you think that it s more reasonable to change your arbitrary believe on what liberty if that will practically change society for better eg the content people would have access on the internet would nt be controlled p i m using internet example here because you chose to talk about net neutrality when it s clear your view ha little to do with it if you want a more dramatic example you can think of the pharmaceutical industry which following your idea would have people die in name of liberty
AH ape in a dress get out of this subreddit racist
NONE you actually made an account just for this comment
AH culture one or two at most diversity in many case a lack thereof ignorance is a powerful thing
NONE the law is still in the hand of people some of which should nt be trusted to be alone with sharp object
AH for some reason i do nt believe you first hr ca nt legally tell you that second how would you know the black guy s gpa if you knew this black guy enough to know his gpa you would consider that person a friend and be happy they got a job you are racist and full of shit
NONE i ve said it before i feel that if the father want an abortion and the mother doe nt then the father waif all right make it so he ca nt have any contact at all and wo nt be liable for child support i realize i m not really changing your view just wanted to throw in my cent
AH if you re worried about the destruction of the earth by an asteroid you re delusional when the next big thing hit the earth there probably wont even be human on it since evolution kind of make it impossible and we are one of the specie with most selective pressure on them make it happen even faster the best chance we have of witnessing mass extinction a a specie is if it s caused by u through global warming you know where the money you spent on useless colony would be much better spent at stopping global warming by clever engineering and city building renewable energy and environmental education you re more worried about saving a specie after it killed the planet than you are in saving every lifeform including human this just show how biased and anthropocentric you are kind of disgusting really to disregard being that you share so much with comment on this
NONE your first three bullet are correct it only on the rth that you run into some issue we wo nt all be dead not even close we have modern technology like gmos and healthcare and pumping system that make the challenge of climate change largely doable for those with the money to afford them it the poor of the world who are in for it they wo nt be able to escape the effect the way we can a for nature nature will take this in stride this is barely a blip on the radar in term of large scale environmental change throughout natural history i d really like to hear why you think global warming ha the potential to make u all dead i ve never seen any science that indicates anything close to that unless it come from some idiot environmentalist who make up for their lack of actual knowledge about the environment by making ever more dire claim
AH so your argument boil down to i want more game with these ip and not much else it would make the world a better place really i get that you re upset about not getting what you want but this is a place for reasoned argument not whining
NONE i always feel like in any kind of would you rather fight a scenario it s assumed that the opponent would be aggressive and ready to fight otherwise you could probably just walk up to it and gouge out it eye and it d be a meaningless question
AH it s like saying i m gon na call everyone nigger because equality so you re argument is that the word fat which is itself genderneutral in original applicability and meaning is like a racial slur a word that is racist in it definition that s ridiculous and you damage your cause by making such an obviously terrible comparison
NONE ok agreed on caitlyn jenner waste of space however let not pretend like the celebration of the rest of that family is somehow any good your perspective on gender is exactly why you should believe the it is just something that is of your gender exists for others a well just the way it is is nt the same for them a it is for you it s not a feeling a you say it s a reality
AH what the fuck were you expecting that one day all top economist will come forward and predict that an economic collapse is imminent on a certain data and time just the way weatherman predict tsunami the result will x worse collapse and contagion when a weatherman predicts weather then there is no effect of that prediction on weather for sure
NONE humm this is fairly abstract and i dont know if we can have this discussion over a reddit thread this sound more like after a few beer type of conversation so what you are saying is the present that we live in is predetermined because the past ha already been determined and our action in the present are not predetermined but once the decision is made it will lead to a finite and pre determined future
AH the first half is not relevant to the second half the second half is an independent clause it doe not depend on the first part of the text you learned about independent clause in english class right
NONE maybe the first time is bad but the second time is nt if the first time is bad and it s also the first or second date there may not be enough connection to last whereas waiting longer mean greater possibility of a doover
AH not very deffinitive worth more than anything you ve brought to the table
NONE le working people would mean we all get paid more since there s more of a demand for u
AH personally i think you re butthurt that trump won to make this barely feasible for a toplevel comment that d be dumb too much debt and everyone would still hate california
NONE well then thanks i do nt think udeltabot can read delta from edits so you might have to make a new reply but regardless thanks for the discussion wa really interesting
AH uh that s fucking retarded man are you really saying to me that if the south had just said nope we re gon na keep slave the north would have shrugged and moved on
NONE i think you re right most of the people claiming it s in the constitution are just scared to lose their gun i mean cmon man constitution is nt perfect
AH what a rude asshole you are
NONE lol you should do the same
AH i see you running troll i just blew your spot on out of the loop too ask me anything by lildicky in iama – blueguy point hour ago umm wrong person i actually like hiphop head it s definitely one of the better sub on reddit they do a great job discussing hiphop way better than rmusic or another alternative they do a good job talking about what s happening in the culture currently not just the music and also being knowledgeable of the history of hip hop permalinksavecontextfull comment reportgive g now you been put on blast you troll you were an idiot from hhh also that s why you are currently hating on lil dicky and getting downvoted because he represents the very genre you say is full of talent but all you can fucking do is suck eminem s dick every time you need to show a comparison because him and a handful are all you have to claim rap is full of real talent
NONE i do nt have a good verbal argument for this but compare black flag to the bad brain and you ll find tremendous difference i think your rap analogy is pretty solid i friggin love nwa and the wu tang but a lot of people even one who really like rap think most of the wu tang song are weird and boring experimental nonsense they ve got over track and maybe of them are phenomenal while some of the others leave you scratching your head mostly for punk hardcore you re listening for a hook that grab you a lot of it is emotional resonance my war by black flag absolutely fall in the category of fast loud no melody but it grab you and hold you for the whole song if you ve ever had a period in your life where you were just pissed off it s actually really similar to gangsta rap it s about a feeling often one of anger or trying to get over on the system
AH yeah i must be a white dude if i m concerned about the arctic cathrates wiping out most of life on earth kill yourself
NONE i d totally agree with you on the naughty photo the fungoofy one however i d keep stored away somewhere
AH ummm dude you do realize that trade had started up the moment he signed the order that people were already going to cuba through legal flight legal travel is not repealing the embargo do nt speak of what you do nt know it ha had a drastic effect on the healthcare market by slowing price rise the slow down in price increase started before the aca wa passed and year before it went into effect so unless you think obama is a time traveler this is false reagan did more what corruption yes more to destabilize the economy yeah he got rid of a lot of the safeguard skyrocket the incarceration rate yeah he did that too i mean if you want to start taking look at president it a question of what they did with what they had and the situation they were in and reagan s voodoo economics bullshit are still effecting u in negative way today once again you prove that you have no ability to distinguish between presidential skill at achieving his objective and politics you re in favor of i m done wasting my time on a child
NONE my counter position steadily reduce the war on drug i agree wholeheartedly that ending the war on drug appears on paper to be the only sensible option it cost a shitload creates organized crime and cost the life of many who did nothing morally wrong but shit what if we re wrong i m honestly frightened by wholesale radical change we can make our best guess a to what would work better but we ca nt really know for sure that thing will be better just abruptly ending the war on drug there s a change it could go horribly horribly wrong in an irreversible manner i m a believer in the law of unforeseen consequence so i say since it appears ending the war on drug is the right path let s reduce the war on drug and if that seems to be working let s reduce it some more and so on if ending the war on drug is a good idea going at it cautiously wo nt hurt a that much and would still be a major improvement over today s situation if ending the war on drug is a bad idea going at in cautiously will allow u to make adjustment
AH so this is a joke then
NONE lol this is just wrong
AH ok but your comment history paint a pretty racist picture of you
NONE but your view point is silly do nt you get it your view is silly
AH im going to slit your wife throat and shit down her neck
NONE dating preference do nt leave me scratching my head haha
AH i see you re still misquoting me sure is a big number it s a tiny percentage which when were arguing about how common something is is all that matter you re either trolling or have no idea how to debate calling me a liar after directly misquoting me then claiming that me copy and pasting wa actually misquoting is a masterstroke i hear cnn is hiring
NONE a for the academic contributing i think it s just a problem of how since wikipedia is all about honoring anonymity so it can be frustrating if an expert feel like their placed below a random contributor so a it is now i think it definitely hit wiki s credibility edit guess i wa wrong about the delta bot but maybe not i think also got a few delta s from another thread so it might be a bit confusing
AH what have you done to deserve to live here do you understand the consequence of your argument if lineage doesnt matter then affirmative action should be abolished inheratance of property would not be done ive spent every moment of my entire life being an american every single effort ha been an effort that directly affect this country why did you want to be here is it because my lineage created something great and you want to be a part of it if so you have the burden to prove yourself to me and my ancestor not the other way around you i literally hate you for being so ignorant and disrespectful honestly who the fuck come to someone el land and parade around being disrespectful
NONE i am an organ donor i want my organ to go to people who need my organ i do not want my donation of my organ to get involved in notion of social justice of deserving and so on the organ i donate go to someone who is sick because being sick is a really shitty thing it s not less shitty when it happens to an asshole or even to someone who doe nt want to donate their own organ my gift is not contingent i agree with you that it should not be taken for granted i believe that it should be wildly promoted and that we should change our system of becoming an organ donor a you note this is about saving life i believe it to be bad to create a system that implicitly value one life greater than the other and that is what your proposal doe it say that you deserve to live because you are an organ donor and you do nt because you are nt and get your shit together canada
AH do nt take his name in vein fucking monkey
NONE nice try guy who doe nt get second date
AH i failed highschool math twice i quit my crap job with basic degree and i went to night school to get highschool math and physic to enter engineering i fought tooth and nail against my own brain that ca nt understand math to get a master in engineering i now work at the rd biggest oil operator in the world a a petroleum engineer it piss me off when i actually beat the odds and fought for my luck when you float through your baby degree and call it growth i fucking had critical thinking in high school and got every one of your soft growth skill that your degree gave you from simply volunteering during extracurricular activity so you went to uni to discus interesting idea have fun little debate with people and meet people it s a joke it sound like a trip to a waterpark how about solving an equation that take blackboard to fill or something actually impressive how can you even be ok with saying you paid for that if that s all your degree gave you then you should be embarrassed i suppose it doe nt matter that much for you though i can tell you re a girl and aret too bothered about it all because your man will pay for everything you ll ever have in the future why not go out and try achieve something hard for a change just to impress him i know you hate me but hopefully i ll inspire you to actually challenge yourself after this and not live off his back
NONE nothing is stopping someone from just taking the better paying degree other than personal choice and edification if i would rather spend my studying year studying something i really love like russian literature then that s my prerogative if i want to raise a family and eat then i have to find a career that affords me those goal while probably making some compromise in how i spend my time some people prioritize life differently and i do nt see what the problem with that is is it worth taking the huge gamble on getting that career you love is it a huge gamble my brother dedicated a lot of time to becoming an athlete when he wa a child and through college then an injury knocked him out of the running for his passion and now he s a personal trainer he s using the skill he gained reaching for his dream to live the kind of life he want to live wa it practical to focus so much on a sport no but did he make it work yes with enough gumption and resource to help you with your resume you should be able to turn almost any major into a list of skill that will help you work in a practical field so what s the downside of this gamble working a job you did nt really like to begin with that s the status quo if you go the path you re advocating if there s something you re really passionate about you re sure a hell never going to get a career doing it without at least trying edit i would be willing to bet that most people living in poverty are nt in that situation because they choose the wrong major in college
AH i m just unsubbing from this place you re everything wrong with this subreddit
NONE i think sushi is best eaten with hand but again you re ignoring the cheetoes
AH like your candidate you are a loser my friend are coming over sorry i had to wrap the conversation up so soon
NONE hey that s swell i have a new reddit friend i ll come back to this discussion after some coffee
AH keep breeding than it is society job to supply work so that they can survive what since when is it society s job to supply work my ex wa a lawyer and the current supplydemand curve for lawyer is completely overrun with lawyer and not enough wor for corporate lawyer yes my line of work particularly where i work not in a major city i am turning people away because i m so busy so i have absolutely no idea what you re arguing because even the aba admits there s too many lawyer and ha in particular told student to not pursue a law career this is actually funny you do nt understand your own argument this is a supply and demand problem and it ha nothing to do with automation of lawyer which is what this cmv is about the fact that the legal field is overrun with lawyer mean absolutely nothing for your argument your ai argument is for a bankruptcy firm bankruptcy is literally just pushing paper around and doing some math there s no analysis it s accounting you really love those ellipsis they make you sound like an idiot
NONE what you said is true but at the same time is also true of every other adult the key point is that there really is nt any kind of clear dividing line between teen and adult really i have met people who have gone through much more a child including death of parent economic independence etc than other year old adult i know on average i would say you re right but making that kind of blanket judgement is not fair to the very sizable group of people who are not average but i think the most important flaw in this line of thinking is that it implicitly take away power over decision making from you a a young person this is a lesson that i personally learned the hard way just because someone is older doe nt mean they are wiser it s a form of the gambler s fallacy you can waste a lot of time and energy on people who do nt deserve it and this line of thinking turn you into blind tool for them in a well functioning disciplined system like a martial art school or something you can imagine it working but a a general case it s a recipe for exploitation
AH patriarchy men then you re using the wrong word see patri mean father which is necessarily a gendered term people describing the complex social interplay between men and woman a a patriarchy are immature asshole trying to characterize men a unilateral determinors of social norm and woman a emptyheaded child who sit around waiting for a man to tell them what to think but at least that s implicit i do nt call social discourse woman be crazy because that would be a reductive and rather blamey foot to start out on but here you people are being told how offensive your language is to men and you absolutely refuse to listen you want to know why gendered slur like slut continue to see use in our society well here you are still refusing to stop using sexist language so i guess you know but do nt worry i m not gon na go around trying to tell people about a matriarchy and not just because that s a fucking stupid idea i m just going to classify you patriarchy people in the same category a the social infant who populate trp
NONE it interesting that some view feminism a a movement that is nt just allowing woman to be what they want but telling them what they should nt be telling them to shun the idea that they need to be the primary caregiver of the family and cook dinner etc i agree with you to an extent the feminist movement can be explained in very different way if you ask people who claim to be feminist i do not label myself a a feminist personally but i can see what you and the article are getting at here you are equal in every way is obviously not true for either sex woman have an incredible capacity to be caring and endure if men had to go through child birth there would be far fewer child okay but i do nt think having inequality in certain area of life mean that you should conform to gender role in every way i do have an incredible capacity to be caring and endure i also have a mind for logic and legal negotiation are something i excel at one doe nt preclude me from doing the other society is telling men you need to be content to settle down and telling woman do nt be content to be settled i do nt see these message you also failed to address a number of the point i made in my first comment
AH i m literally trying to decide if you re a child or have a mental disability i mean i do nt think i ve ever said this to someone on reddit before but you seem stupid you ca nt seem to follow anyone s argument at all are you on something
NONE yeah i do nt think there s anything to be changed here informed consent is pretty important if you tell me i then have the choice to go forward or not if you do nt tell me then you ve taken away my ability to choose when i go to my doctor i want to know what they re doing if i do nt like it i can say no now i do nt think i ve ever said no to anything a doctor ha suggested but i still expect to be told so that i have a choice
AH avoiding a class of people because you are afraid of what some might do is bigotry it s being afraid of what they are able to do similarly black men in the old day were afraid of being around white woman because they could be beaten to death if they looked at them wrong you would call me a man hater for suggesting woman avoid men who have the capability to rape no i would call you an idiot because the law protects you and a woman is equally capable of raping you you ll never be able to change your view unless you engage with the argument i m presenting without distracting with tangent it wa nt a tangent it wa a supporting piece of evidence i linked it directly to my claim my claim being there are nonbigotted reason to not want relationship with woman
NONE i suppose you can look at it that way but by not reporting something you know you are also partly responsible for that person s future action so if i know that my neighbor is beating his wife if i do nt tell the police i m partially responsible for any future harm his wife experience or you can step back even farther if i know that there are starving child in africa by not sending them money and support i m at least partially responsible for their death this is a complex moral question and it s been captured in the trolley problem http enwikipediaorgwikitrolleyproblem this topic reminds me of the quote victory ha a hundred father and defeat is an orphan people tend to want to claim this type of tangential responsibility for good thing but they want to avoid it when it come to bad thing
AH shame me into silence oh god the irony it hurt if this is indicative of your ability to argue i d be pretty concerned with yourself
NONE i do nt know if i can change your view but i am glad there is vocal disgust over this sad disturbing turn of event a opposed to quiet acceptance it is a small relief to see that
AH at least the left mostly keep it to verbal silencing trump want to fucking sue you wut a a fellow white person do you actually think that you are being demonized and marginalized the feminist stuff doe nt relate to public policy so while she s wrong idgaf nope more illegal immigrant are leaving than coming are you really retarded or just uninformed perhaps but banning them wo nt help it doe nt matter if he s negotiating for bad thing even if we assume that hillary is self interested her self interest are to tow the party line to get elected again literally irrelevant and also untrue trumpu hello not even going to respond you do understand that there exists this thing called ethic and not everyone who is well off is a sociopath who look at the plight of others and just say well fuck em besides the welfare queen trope is objectively false what other social program are you against the one that made this country great new deal social security etc the guy who shot the cop wa literally not a member of blm nbp is an extremist organisation categorized a a hate group by the southern poverty law center that s like saying that christian are domestic terrorist bcs of abortion clinic bombing
NONE do we all know them because that s definitely not the case just look at the whole why wa nt sr banned alongside fph if brigading is the issue debacle it show obvious bias in the decision making process about who doe and doe nt get banned what if some those statistic about black people are true and promote relevant discussion should we never be allowed to mention true fact because certain people get offended by the truth what is hate speech even hate speech is speech that offends threatens or insult group based on race color religion national origin sexual orientation disability or other trait that s pretty goddamn broad and many people could claim to be offended insulted or threatened by many thing censorship is never the black and white issue that you want to make it out to be you re sitting there saying it s easy just get rid of these thing that i do nt like and leave the rest that i do like alone but your opinion is nt universal open your mind outside your own world there are religious people who find gay marriage and abortion offensive should we ban any sub related to them to keep strictly religious people happy it is difficult obviously you have nt thought through the complexity of determining what doe and doe not get to be displayed outside of cut out the thing i think are bad
AH oh my god i totally forgot that the school are out for summer
NONE ok so my reply wa so long i had to split it in two see my two child comment
AH nice try at arrogance there typical internet wanker scrambling for an edge but you did dodge the point entirely if union are so detrimental why do company and economy thrive despite them if supply and demand are natural law of the market then unionizing sindicating associating and all other collective negotiation is also a part of the natural law unless your union leader is some sort of gandalf like supernatural
NONE you seem to be framing the argument a more efficient mean better our government wa intentionally designed to be slow and inefficient because nobody can take away freedom and resource quite like government the other advantage of a presidential system is that the government is much le response to the will of the majority while this might seem bad on the surface it can actually enhance the ability of minority view to be represented
AH you know i m a man right lol why would that matter you do nt agree that there are systemic bias against woman in society no there are nt there are gender stereotype which constrain the freedom of choice of all gender in different way yes there is no big conspiracy to hold woman down so even trying to argue any other detail would be fruitless i take notice of the fact that you refuse to debate with people who do nt agree with you typical feminist
NONE if it make you feel better op i know exactly what you re talking about there seems to be a group of trans people mostly transmen from what i ve seen that do nt appear to have any significant gender dysphoria and make no attempt to pas or present differently in any way they re slightly tomboyish not even necessarily preferring girl and insist on male pronoun this seems to be a social thing and a lot different from the profound gender dysphoria i ve seen in people that i would call trans
AH i just wrote that there were scientific reason and you just copied me boiling my answer down to yes is not my answer sound like we may have to prepare for your reading with reading comprehension also i mentioned those reason above read the thread then comment it s not difficult
NONE unfortunately i do nt know enough about microfinance to answer your question however given the number who would still stand to benefit from these loan i think it will be awhile before it s an issue and thank you for the delta in the other comment my first one it seems to have not worked but i do appreciate it
AH you re making the same moronic argument a the left when they compare trump to hitler simply because of white nationalism it s fucking ridiculous and serf nobody a purpose not to mention that mlk is typically excused from these thing a society did nt see gay marriage the same way back then similar to how i disagree with taking down confederate statue under a hard on immigration point it make sense for people to support arpaio for being hard on immigrant but you ignore the whole inane birther movement his conviction of people who had nothing to do with certain crime and everything else he doe wrong it doe change nothing i never disagreed with you there anyone who still think that this change anything is deluded i m even willing to bet that trump would be reelected even if i think that the man is a terrible president the poll all had him losing before the election so why trust them when it measure his approval rating now it s not that i do nt agree with you but straw men are incredibly useless and when anyone point that out you reply that you re just making an analogy yeah well your analogy is still shit
NONE i like that idea but i do nt think it s actually a good strategy it work when it move the debate to why it matter to those people it matter because with homophobia come a lot of false idea that need to be tackled like the idea that gay want to fck all men they see or that trans people are a bit of the same maybe pedophile with this i do nt really know what transphobic people think if you say that it doe nt matter you re saying to their face that what many threat they see doe nt matter to you and so you ll be called a libtard or a destroyer of history society american spirit and so on so indifference is nt the good strategy i think while there s not much proof that arguing with fact work better it s important to be able to answer wrong notion those people have but rather than explaining that they are wrong a you point out it s more pertinent to explain how not dangerous it is and that gay and trans people are responsible of their life and their action a adult and a citizen it doe nt matter in the sense that it doe nt affect them but they do believe it s affecting them
AH i say you are intellectually dishonest and i have explained why many time you are also being intellectually dishonest because you accused me of disregarding your point you called me typical redditor while you refuse to answer any of my question so if you have some intellectual honesty please answer my point and direct fucking question that you have so far avoided if you do nt do that you have proved my point and i will rest my case i ll even make it easy for you and list some of them here i did nt see any reason to answer any of your selfaggrandizing boastfullness if it is supposed to mean anything it is nothing more than an argument from authority i am not impressed any reply to this why bring it other people intellectual dishonesty up at all do you think the fact that other user are also intellectual dishonest in some way exuse the fact that you are can you please answer this now the fourth fucking time i ask you this question the statement that there is literally nothing that he can say to change your mind mean just that what you are saying now is that you said there is nothing he can say to change your mind if the only thing he say is why i am sure that someone with your superior intelligence can see the difference between the two sentence the first statement that you actually made go back and see is incredibly arrogant the second statement is obviously ridiculous and incredibly obvious it like saying there is nothing you can say to change my mind if you say nothing if that wa your original statement it would not have resulted in this discussion because how the fuck can anyone disagree with that moronic sentence any comment to this or are you just going to keep on pretending it is nt there
NONE what i m getting at here is why you thought the accent added to the joke i guess you can see how the fact that you did could be interpreted a racism i think maybe that part of the joke wa that he wa saying something so insanely crass and you usually do nt hear people with that accent saying something so insanely filthy that sound like a reasonable explanation to me nevertheless i would tread carefully in this area it s not unreasonable for people to assume that the reason you used it is because you think indian accent are inherently funny think about it this way if your friend had an american accent but a lisp would you have imitated that while telling the joke if they had had to have a leg amputated would you have hopped around on one leg while telling it if you had can you see why people might find that offensive what is the difference between those instance and this one after all you do nt often hear disabled people saying something filthy either there s a big difference between intention and perception i think part of being being a thoughtful member of society is considering the potential for such a gap and the way our word might affect others in the current social context people who are particularly sensitive about racism can not really be blamed for interpreting your joke a a racist one personally fwiw i do nt think i would label it a such but i can not say you friend wa wrong either because i can see exactly where he wa coming from and it s important to be mindful of what might offend others if not for any other reason then because next time it might be your bos you tick off or your partner s feeling you really hurt or another friend s confidence you undermine all without intending to do anything but tell a funny joke word are weapon it s important to understand their impact so we can wield them with precision
AH do nt be dense he s not insulting men on the basis that they are men but he is insulting woman on the basis of them being woman
NONE he say pretty clearly that woman bear child his curse of woman is biological in nature so he must be thinking of woman a biological
AH i would love for you to explain exactly how a word for a type of society or a household mentality is a slur a type of society fascist is used a a slur all the time a is communist and even socialist household mentality welfare queen is quite reductive and hateful because the patriarchy is not and ha never been a slur nor ha it been used a one you completely trivialize what slur by this comparison and what it it mean for something to be one just because you re needlessly offended doe nt make it a slur because a slur is a word that ha been used to be derogatory towards a group of people this is exactly what bigot say to defend their insensitive and hateful word i hope you can at least use this opportunity to understand why people think and act that way now that you re doing it yourself i suspect that my hope is in vain however you seem completely intent on denying my experience and that of other men i would nt tell woman that they were needlessly offended by gendered slur but i ca nt expect everyone else to be mature least of all some random kid on the internet i hope you get yourself sorted out eventually if you are nt a troll how are you not noticing a difference in the type of word you re using the difference is gender you think gendered slur against men are acceptable but are still offended by slur against woman it s easy to see once you care about both gender
NONE let me tell you why i believe that whether or not people laugh is a irrelevant to the offensiveness of the joke a the joke content is imho there is no offensive language at all doe nt exist saying that any word or sentence is offensive is like blaming knife for people who get stabbed therefore no joke is inherently offensive word are there to convey our thought the problem is that what people infer from the word we use often ha no relation at all to what we actually intended to say because some people are just looking for an opportunity to be offended therefore i am firmly of the opinion that if you do not intend to give offense what you re saying is not offensive i can do nigger joke a much a i want if they re in good faith and good fun and for those that are offended now because i did nt blip out the nword i m black so i get to use it see suddenly le offensive to many people and no i do nt use it except for such illustration because of overlysensitive people anyway my point is that labeling word or joke a offensive is ridiculous because then i can decide that i m offended at the word thanks and giving and suddenly thanksgiving is offensive the world doe nt or rather should nt work that way just a a crime need a motive being legitimately offended doe should therefore there are no offensive joke only offensive wannabe comedian
AH you are truly moronic if you think that you can call obama that nigger and think that s like an okay thing to do obviously if you are at the point in your life where dropping hard r n word is your thing then you re either older and there s no changing you or you grew up around that which is probably sadder
NONE i agree one of the thing i thought when the caitlyn jenner thing wa going on wa that if men are going to start identifying themselves a woman or vice versa what come next if your gender is something that you can choose why ca nt you choose other trait that you are born with this is where the slippery slope start
AH adopted black people in sweden are swedish in culture what are you insane they are never swedish in culture have you visited sweden i have btw
NONE how dare you imply equality under the law and due process constitute and fair and free society do you really think gloria steinem died on the cross so we could have trial
AH if a woman doesnt want to be stuck with a kid she shouldnt have sex if she doesnt want someone to father her child she shouldnt have sex with a man who dosent want child it the same logic that is correct if you agree with that bit about personal responsibility you shouldnt take issue with a man not paying child support dont have sex with a man who dosent want to father your child and theyll be no issue or better yet just have an abortion or adoption a man dosent have these choice why is it fair for men to become parent without going through pregnancy why are nt you advocating for some kind of equalizer not a single man ha ever died during pregnancy million and million of woman have so obviously the solution is to kill a proportional number of men who might want to become dad it s only fair right what a ridiculous thing to say the conversation about reproductive right not the biological fact that woman carry baby woman arguably have more right with regard to being able to terminate the pregnancy whether or not the man want the child to be born and i agree with that it their body and theyre carrying the child but a man who doe not want to be a parent should be able to absolve himself of parenthood just a a woman is able to the assertion that every single time someone ha sex they should prepare to have child is ridiculous it go against the entire point of birth control then do nt come cry to me when your birth control fails i respect that youre being consistent but you cant be serious it the whole point of birth control is that people should be able to have casual sex without having unwanted child the notion that every single time someone consent to sex they should risk having a child is an antiquated point of view
NONE i agree with you that woman should not drink i also believe there is no safe amount i ve met fetal alcohol syndrome kid and any woman who doe that to her child is a horrible person however your proposal put the burden of assessing pregnancy on the waitress or bartender it s not their job and it s very hard to reliably detect pregnancy at just a glance for example right now i m week along which mean delivery is very close but i never got a baby bump i wa slow to tell my friend the news and none of them guessed a percentage of woman just do nt look pregnant by the end and no woman look pregnant early on how do you propose the restaurant enforce such a policy if there s no reliable way to know for sure who is or is nt do you require they do a pee stick test before ordering there is also the very awkward conversation that happens when a bartender asks or assumes a notskinny woman might be pregnant not all bigger woman are pregnant and not all pregnant woman are bigger this could be perceived a hurtful or offensive to ask is this an appropriate role for a waitress guardian of fetus health should the waitress kick out any woman who are smoking and might be pregnant doe the waitress call police for endangerment if she overhears the pregnant woman talk about recent drug use or a desire to buy recreational drug the bigger picture is that generally what the mother doe when pregnant is not considered child abuse because the law doe nt see the fetus a a person until birth if the law doe nt see the pg woman drinking a anything wrong why would the bartender be responsible for her
AH hahahaha if you think the u lost it european ally over this you are delusional
NONE yeah but the nazi stole all their bicycle during the war so i think we can call it even
AH i think that s perhaps antithetical to having individual freedom however to preserve our freedom we have had to make compromise and the effect of them linger if we collectively care enough about this country we would use our freedom to defend it freely we do nt need to be forced to do so if ss wa a opposed to american value a you just argued it would nt exist that s what you said i did nt say any such thing i think you re have a hard time with either logical reasoning or reading comprehension
NONE not necessarily that they cancel each other out just that what we consider an improvement may not always be an improvement and it certainly might not make you better suited to your environment just a another point most people do nt need to be stronger or faster or anything like that so what purpose doe it serve to design them like that i m not saying that you ca nt improve the specie by getting rid of some bad stuff i m saying that it s not always so clearcut and what seems better might not be the way that evolution would have taken u
AH i do nt want to assume that anybody on this sub is a troll because calling out view a trolling is unhelpful to a discussion but looking at his other comment here i think you re right he appears to be a troll
NONE you re gon na have a hard time finding someone who doe nt believe in climate change on reddit the only group that really belief that it doe nt exist is the faaaaaar right and they do nt browse reddit
AH you re completely off your rocker if you actually think you made it by your own bootstraps kid there s nothing successful or special about you except because capitalism reinforces that delusion you re just a susceptible to getting knocked off a the next guy please quit it with your special snowflake bull
NONE not saying i would do this but if your neighbor want to be a snob about it which it seems like she kind of is you could remind her that it would be legal for you to shoot that cat if it s on your property not suggesting you actually do it but maybe hearing that she will make her own backyard more suitable and at least try to keep it out of yours
AH i believe in treating these people just a well a trump treated people during his campaign you on the other hand are being a fascist apologist and that s how you continue to empower them
NONE i would disagree with you they lost all credibility when they decided to stop reporting news and try to create narrative with their medium presence this wa just a manifestation of that mindset
AH and i m especially angry that you would undermine my gender when apparently trying to defend the right of those like me assuming you re not lying that make both of u trans you re defending shitty ci people discourse and are definitely not defending my right ah there it is shitty ci people discourse i ve explained many time in my reply to you why it s useful to use male and female within science to describe male and female organism but you keep reducing it to transphobia or a you have said just now shitty ci people discourse
NONE i get what you re saying but gay ha moved in a gendered direction and i m not sure it s possible or desirable to pull it back even if it doe nt mean cisgay men to you it doe to many people not just the person who sent you the pm plus a you mentioned above it would nt include people who identify a trans so if you wanted a community that included more identity than gay meaning homosexual then gay doe nt work some other umbrella people have suggested are queer and gender and sexual minority
AH this entire time my inbox ha been flooded with people like you who keep taking what i say and going you re hitler for supporting rape culture not to mention i never said anything about nonconservatives but then again you re just another person to strawman me today maybe i should start hating nonconservatives because you pissed in my corn flake mother fucker at least they do nt piss in my corn flake all they do is ask me to go to church and celebrate baby jesus also i m just asking for evidence just link an alternative that s all you had to do maybe if you did nt spend so much time pissing in people s cornflakes you would notice this and just send a link
NONE if stranger are nt bothered by people talking to them i imagine people are even le likely to be annoyed by someone talking to them if they know the person i think the real question is why do you have this fear would it really be so bad if you did annoy someone keep in mind that annoying someone doe nt actually mean you are annoying ex if i start talking to someone about art and they hate art they might find me annoying but that doe nt mean that there is anything wrong with my interest or who i am a a person start small comment on something you like about another person hey those are cool shoe i wa thinking of getting some red one like that how do you like them and then if you start to get uncomfortable exit the conversation gracefully it wa nice talking to you i got ta go thanks
AH also water in many european city taste bad by virtue of being massively overchlorinated that s because no one drink tap water there it s selfreinforcing bullshit
NONE is nt it easier now with social medium and now that there is le of a risk of backlash due to a more tolerant society oh certainly in many place but it s not better everywhere
AH you sure like cherry picking tell you what how about i go back to what i wa doing before responding to you and you go back to defending israel in every comment submission and subreddit you go to

AH i could not care le about what sex i really am clearly not true or else you would have been fine being female which is what you really are and it ha nothing to do with the fact that taking male hormone and living a a man is what made my life livable yes taking hormone and living a a man is just you a a woman living a lie since you re not actually male it doe nt matter how much you look like one you re still living a lie
NONE i have a question how come some people consider abortion a woman s right when the child in the mother womb is nt her body it s a different body it ha a different blood type different organ it s own heart beat there is no denying that a fetus is it own body so why do liberal think that abortion is a woman s right edit i do nt mean to offend anyone or start an argument i just simply want to know how people can think this
AH you must be a nigger
NONE you ca nt be serious
AH according to ali soufan very few al qaeda member actually read the koran didier francois ha said that the isi member who held him for month did nt even have a koran this is irrelevant most christian do nt read the bible but they re still christian and they still get their belief from the bible and their priest and preacher the same go for muslim and their imam the best suicide bomber in history were atheist harris know nothing of history your defense of him well it reflects on you because who could forget when those atheist flew plane into the world trade center and the pentagon your ignorance is truly astonishing
NONE i ll bite you claim that kushner is potentially descended from the tribe of dan so we know that kushner s parent are both orthodox jew his father being the son of holocaust survivor from belarus and his mother based on her maiden name of stadtmauer being of germanic descent the tribe of dan is one of the ten lost tribe of israel so we do nt know where they ended up we just know they were nt in israel most theory place them south in ethiopia and sudan at the same time we know that the spread of judaism into europe ha it root in the tribe of judah and benjamin according to josephus so it seems unlikely that kushner would meet that criterion
AH and when someone s sign say private property no trespassing going to the city hall to request that their property be made public is just dumb quit advocating tyranny congratulation you just invented property tax which exist and are a good thing also when you start aggressively calling people who agree with you dumb and accusing them of advocating tyranny you kinda just look like an insecure dick
NONE if you ca nt tell a cop fuck you to his face for no reason other than you have the legal freedom to do so without getting yourself thrown in jail then you can say we do nt live in a police state yeah it s a stupid example but law enforcer need to be the strongest example of adhering to the law it doe nt make sense to see that they are often the first to violate the very law they are sworn to uphold
AH and you re exactly the type of person they want gullible why do nt you read it before passing judgement oh no that would require effort and ability which it s clear you do nt have now pop back under the rock you crawled out from under it s safer there did nt your mum tell you btw have you any idea where the term conspiracy theorist come from i did nt think so
NONE while your half right about freedom etc your missing the point it not that they do it it that they do it on thing they do not own and that set a bad precedent doe nt matter how it look you do nt own it you do nt damage it is one of those rule that should be taught it doe not matter if you think it look better that way or you really want to you do nt own it you do nt damage it

NONE global warming this is clearly a problem denying it is stupid this is one of the main reason i wa hesitant to back any republican for year this is the reason you should nt vote for trump if you understand the severity of global warming and the immediacy with which we need to act and based on your statement i d assume you have a general idea then trump would have to be your last choice for president watch for instance trump s speech http wwwyoutubecomwatch visorzcaa on energy policy in north dakota he start a bit after an hour in keep in mind by the way that most of what he say is nt true it s just a bunch of lie that you can disprove with a quick search not only doe he deny climate change but he want to destroy the epa and environmental regulation in general increase oil natural gas and coal production and destroy the paris climate agreement that would be disastrous for the planet thing are already bad a they are now noaa recently released a report http wwwnefscnoaagovpressreleaseprscispotss saying that global warming s affect on our ocean is worse than originally thought i m not saying you have to vote for the democratic nominee i still do nt think i will end up doing that but independent of all of trump s other view this alone should be enough for you not to vote for him a a scientist i find a trump presidency to be very distressing
AH oh good i m glad being respectful of other people is such a heavy burden for you fuck off
NONE wow this response made me super happy for some reason i will do this with my own child
AH well it not a fair appraisal the difficulty of all men to get laid is part and parcel of the same reason objectification exists at all like many you want to make this about my personal quest to get laid so you can dismiss what im sayingthats coolthats your thing
NONE then thats a tautology acknowleging that your own view might be wrong by definition mean you dont have faith in it but most people would define accept in this context a just letting the other people be and letting them live happily in their delusion
AH okay and banana share ton of dna with u your point well you seem to be incredibly sensitive about this nonissue that you re trying to pull out of your as before you try to argue science you might want to go back to school th grade biology can do wonder for your limited pool of knowledge at least you can stop yourself from embarrassing yourself in the future my coworkers and i had a good laugh over this comment thread
NONE to your second point it s a waste of your time to write it because it wo nt change someone s mind it s a waste of my time because i wo nt change my mind it s a waste of time for anyone who come along to challenge your point of view lot of downvotes await let me tell you it would change mind other than yours the average person wish to be correct usually telling people change their view of course you do nt give a damn but many do
AH if you think that killing someone is a legitimate response to a slap you re not making an argument you re just showing everyone that you re an idiot but wait let s play how much of an idiot are you which of these would be a legitimate retaliation in this case tie her up and cut off her finger waterboard her decapitate her all of the above and then kill her family
NONE for one thing your notion of perfect may not be the same for everyone to use your example if that person with big foot is unhappy about his or her big foot is his life perfect not to him or her so i think the very notion of perfection is unreasonable everyone want thing they do nt have and everyone suffers at some point someone you know will hurt you someone close to you will die you will get sick or injured etc

AH your argument is basically the all life matter argument where did you pull that bizarre and nonsensical comparison from teach men not to rape is your one sentence summation of this issue it obviously more broad and complex than that i m addressing the teach men not to rape component specificallyin intellctual discussion we call that the topic they may be off by but it is overwhelmingly obvious that men commit the vast majority of rape which is why men are the focus of antirape campaign well we could question it i recall a study in a college that showed something like of men had been the subject of unwanted female advancesbut i do nt want to focus too much on that point men being the vast majority of catcallers unwanted advance and even rape make a lot of sense given that men do virtually all the approaching and all the first move to take the example of unwanted approach if men are doing say of the approaching it a mathematical certainty that the population of unwanted approach are going to be hugely in the male corner bottom line is this is just the same shit they teach you in kindergarten keep your hand to yourself use your word leave her alone she doe nt like you touching her this is all basic playground shit we should all be learning in the first year of school thats quite different to my idea of playground my idea of playground is playing with other kid mockfighting rolling around in the grass and so on if someone hasnt told you you can touch them dont touch them i playfully punch friend all the time it pretty commonthey didnt tell me i can
NONE sorry for being so dense a dense it seems a the other woman who designed the shirt she must be having a good laugh over how stupid she s been i m kidding of course i m a woman therefore i ca nt possibly have picked up any of the sexism that permeates our society i doubt it work that way for what it s worth i m not looking to put the artist nor you under fire here i do nt think her art is harmful by itself which is in fact my next point this whole affair is symptomatic of the new state of thing people take something out of context then add their own this would be where i would essentially disagree people did nt add their own context but instead analysed the shirt on the context it appeared on outside any context the shirt is indeed harmless and meaningless on the context of our deeply misogynist society and furthermore on the context of stem career in which there are four men for every woman it carry a completely different meaning keep in mind this is independent from the meaning the artist intended which wa probably not in this line at all for starter it is quite easy to interpret a painting of halfnaked woman covered in pvc a a reinforcement of the objectification of woman that is common to our society but furthermore it reinforces a feeling i m told most woman on tech and science know very well the one that they re not welcome on the male club and that their need are not taken into account this is reinforced by the fact that no one on esa thought about warning this guy on the implication of his shirt personally i do nt believe this man had any malice but that doe nt invalidate that the way he dressed had very specific implication to woman in tech
AH okay and banana share ton of dna with u it doe nt matter it s one gene or one quark that make the difference about how male develop the difference is the difference the demarcation dgaf what your little social club prefers to say so that feefees do nt get hurt

NONE i thinkit depends on the situation if they are standing in the middle of a group then it seems quite rude however some people do nt speak english very good and depending on what they re talking about it might be a lot easier to say it in their language especially when it s something you wo nt really understand anyway for example if i tell a small joke about my mom to a friend and yoy do nt know her but i have to admit that it really bug me when people are talking about me in a different language right in front of me especially when it s something bad for example my gf s mom who rant about something i ve screwed up in russian right in front of me how should i react when i hear someone talking angry and every sentence ha my name in it

AH focus here man you are doing exactly what i pointed out a a flaw in your discourse i am not even arguing with you about trump and your opinion of him you are painting me with your dislike of him without knowing me at all thats the problem here you are making the conversation difficult by convoluting everything i say with your antitrump rhetoric i am not even talking about trump you seem obsessed with him for some reason you say you are intolerant not me you literally say based on people s belief you disregard them that s discriminating them for their belief you are the antagonistic one labelling people stereotyping condescending angry at the idea that someone can have a different opinion i am repeating myself here you dont treat people with respect you assume your belief are truth you are the immovable that doe nt make you the right one that make you the ignorant bigoted one wake up dude
NONE f people have point of view that to my mind are underdeveloped ignorant or too extreme am i wrong to ignore them am i wrong to have this kind of filter on life what you experience is confirmation bias you simply love to watch thing you agree with or that which support your agenda it s biological thing nothing you can do about it but i can saythat everything you watch ha value in it i love watching long debate s of course i love debate where i agree with someone rather than debate in which i do nt but nevertheless it s interesting to be exposed to people s argument it s my hobby at this point even the most fool hardy people i come across i observe their argument their train of thought their logic and i try to adapt my argument to manipulate them into agreeing with me watching how people think watching how they behave watching how their bias shape their argument that s the interesting part in my opinion of course you might not care for that and only care about what the people might say but you should nt listen is a blanket statement and blanket statement are usually incorrect you simply must judge if the people is worth debating or not for me it s always worth since i gain valuable experience in debating for example
AH of course it should do nt be dumb

AH canadian who do you think i mean did you read the cmv you re just berating me for obvious answer noone said you had to be happy about my post calling me name because you have beef with people is really low i m allowed to have my own opinion about certain culture a you have about others that doe nt make me racist insurance company wo nt insure certain breed because of an attached stereotype we categorize political party by stereotype food association with culture religion and any other thing under the sun oh but watch the fuck out if you categorize any race and it not be a joke screw you and whatever little fantasy you live in and keep your pasely feeling to yourself if you get this butt hurt over me categorizing a culture that s your problem
NONE i agree with you i find it irritating for a start even if the service wa bad i would never want to hurt the waiter s feeling they re already doing a not very fun job i do nt want to make it worse for them but i feel embarrassed giving them a tip it s a bit demeaning it reinforces the idea that you are in a relationship with them where you are powerful and they have le power and are dependent upon your beneficence i would much prefer that i wa told how much to pay and some of the money automatically went to them i do nt like that idea that i am sitting in judgement on them or superior also it s awkward when you re paying by debit card i do nt even know how that work do you have to tell them to add a tip on that mean you have to discus with them how much you are going to tip them to me that s even more embarrassing

AH lol you re a really stupid asshole fuck off
NONE man fucking google that shit it s not hard
AH ok you re obviously a high school kid who ha little life experience and ha nt even taken a college economics or sociology course i will forgive your arrogance and misunderstanding of how term like wealth class race and income interact with the real world i ll just jump straight to the central question is it right or just for a rich black kid to get an advantage over a poor white kid without context of course that on it face is an injustice however this is not an issue without context and we are nt talking about hypothetical we know because it ha been repeatedly studied and documented we know that ending race based affirmative action will take thousand maybe million of black kid out of college or at least higher quality college it mean that we are punishing thousand or million of already poor and the most vulnerable member of our society for the sake of that one rich black kid and one poor white kid i m not looking at this on the micro level on a macro level we know moving to what you propose will hurt a huge percentage of a poverty stricken population it s like deciding that native american are getting an unfair advantage by having reservation free from federal government rule and taking it away from them it may seem fair for all american citizen to be under the same rule but it miss the vital context of why they have reservation and why that s really not the advantage you think it is it s just the bare minimum we can do which is exactly how i would describe affirmative action
NONE child represents to them a cheap soldier or cheap labor and an uneducated voter and uninformed consumer i get what you re saying i just do nt think it make sense everyone is better off if instead of producing child everyone becomes like child it is nt zerosum what you re talking about essentially amount to a conspiracy theory so i m not sure that i m going to be able to change your mind about that but you should probably reexamine the assumption that people including the puppet master are better off with a poor uneducated population in other word are we better off with a population full of the bill gate of the world or the people who are a net drain to society i m not sure how to give this to you short of anecdotal case a i m not entirely sure what you re asking for what i m getting at in asking for support for this is that your whole idea is underpinned by an unfounded assumption if the moral sale pitch concept were real and for the purpose you re describing you should expect to see a strong correlation of opposition to abortion and opposition to birth control i do nt believe that correlation exists at least to the extent you would expect if this were some kind of mechanism to keep the lower rung of society poor and uneducated the only real example of a correlation is in the catholic church which obviously is nt anything like a majority of the population and even then only the most conservative people oppose birth control
AH i did nt say all nazi were violent i said there were no antiviolent nazi reading comprehension and yes killing jew is a core belief of nazism i m done arguing with you you re not interesting

AH so you admit one opinion is valid at one point but invalid at another how doe one keep up with your currently sjw approved opinion do i have to check in with huffpo or salon or some other feminist rag to make sure my opinion do nt need to be adjusted doe one have to occasionally check in with the sjw mob hive mind and make sure none of their opinion have been judged invalid seriously i want to know who get to decide whose opinion is valid and whose is nt when is the next scheduled update to the sjw approved opinion you are just demonstrating to me why i do nt belong with the lefty anymore this smug childish sense of self righteousness even if you have accomplished absolutely nothing which is derived from being orthodox and in harmony within the currently acceptable opinion pool the complete rejection of intellectual curiosity or questioning the party line ha made the left pretty unattractive tbqh it used to be the party of intellectualism and free thought how the table have turned
NONE after reading through some comment i ve decided that it should be both person s responsibility to inform the other but not equally so that is something to consider all the post that are trying to equate it to race or being the same thing a an infertile ci gendered person are completely missing the point and being dumb it s simply an issue that directly relates to sex i see it like someone with an std it s both your responsibility to ask and their responsibility to inform you both situation are awkward but it s more on them to let you know since they already know the situation and you do nt you are the ignorant one here they should inform you this is a footnote from me this is comment is challenging his notion that the other party is responsible and suggesting that part of the responsibility is on op if the mod would like me to draw it out with crayon i can
AH what the fuck have you done why should we even let you into our country entitled fuck
NONE just because it s your mind doe nt mean that you have complete control over it lol k
AH i m not going to get nitty gritty with this or even provide a full response i ll just simply say your hypothesis is simply incorrect cannibalistic is this setting would describe the act of human eating the flesh of other human saying capitalism is cannibalistic is hyperbole and it completely lessens any point you make afterwards so to help change your view i recommend not being intellectually dishonest about thing you want to criticize in this case capitalism your hypothesis clearly is nt that capitalism equates to cannibalism and saying so is just an appeal to emotion that or make sure you know the definition of the word before you use it
NONE if the opposition clearly state their point then you want to upvote it because obviously you will be debunking their logic in the following reply hiding bad logic doe nt allow it to be pilloried and rejected to a wide audience which if you disagree with it should be your objective it s the same reason why you do nt want to censor thing if your view is correct then you should feel comfortable that your argument will win censoring implies that you fear the disagreement downvoting for incorrect fact is different since they simply confuse the issue it s important to be able to discern what is an bad argument and what is a false claim
AH great strawman there totally what i said and totally an answer to the fact you still have nt made an argument nbsp since the s there ha been an increase in co emission some of that increase come from the electricity used by people who grow pot in their attic some of that increase come from car nbsp no one is saying that overusing electricity to grow marihuana is not in some way contributing to the increase of co emission but you d be an idiot to say it contributes more than car nbsp similarly no one is saying that trump is not in some way contributing to the increase of antiislam feeling but you have made no argument why it would contribute more so than terrorist attack by muslim
NONE you do nt have a problem with it excellent but the rest of the world doe nt share your view and that on it own creates a downside to torture it will tarnish the reputation of the u whether or not it is rationally justified many people are very uneasy with utilitarian calculation in which people s life or health are deliberately sacrificed even when inaction could be far more damaging search the trolley problem for a hypothetical example so whether or not these people are right to object to this use of torture they will and you have to consider that when weighing the pro and con it might still be worth it but if torture is nt that effective after all the side effect might be too much
AH op stop being a bitch
NONE i like to be surprised
AH and unless i m ordering coffee i try to avoid ever talking to people who did nt go to college but i find myself needing to make exception for trump voter now that we ve both had our fun with the insult do you actually have any evidence or do you actually think anyone is being fooled by this nonsense

AH are you honestly this slow or do you read thing backwards by any chance different study have linked the different brain structure with gender dysphoria and verified the existence of that brain structure in child a young a and a new study is seeking to monitor the development of this brain structure this is pretty convincing evidence a long a you have half a brain to understand it and i m glad you brought up ad hominem because it further prof your ignorance honestly if you ca nt even differentiate between an ad hominem and a simple insult i do nt have much hope for you i would provide a link so you can learn what an ad hominem is but we both know you wo nt be able to grasp it but sure let s match reading comprehension i m certified with a c reading comprehension in english by the british council through a certificate of professional english cpe what certificate do you have
NONE teacher here we need to be clear about some terminology if by source you mean something that you read in the process of doing research then by all mean use wikipedia why not the object is learning if you re trying to convince someone using evidence you convince better if you have the best possible witness to that evidence this will almost never mean a highlevel synthesis like a somethingpedia so whether i let my student include a wikipedia article in a bibliography depends on the purpose of the bibliography am i tracking what they have read in the process of research sure use it especially if you are new to the topic do i want them to support an argument with evidence find a more authoritative treatment of the evidence it doe nt matter to me whether the article is locked or not all knowledge source should be viewed critically wikipedia just help u remember to keep our guard up

NONE no we do not need more clown mime
AH stop being lazy she is describing her experience she s even on a board dedicated to investigating why her experience might be inherently wrong it s pathetic to accuse her of that look at virtually any other reply to this submission and at how people can contribute to discussion without oneliner buzzword labelling you also downvoted against reddit guideline which is even sadder
NONE eh it wa an ineffective rhetorical ploy the point i wa trying to make is that it s really really hard to remember to care about thing that you never see or hear about we re talking to people who have never met an lgbt person a lot of the time to them it s a real an issue a dehydration in india or hunger in subsaharan africa are and about a hard to motivate yourself to do something about
AH how weak and impressionable are you that you think a reddit commenter could make your life worthless jesus kid have a little self esteem

AH well i m old enough to have a law degree and understand that the comparison you made wa an illegal act to a legal one my whole point wa that it s a poor comparison a better comparison would be two totally legal but equally inconsiderate act say fertilizing your garden with manure in a residential area it s stink to high hell and annoys the fuck out of me for far longer than someone driving past with loud exhaust that said despite your immature illinformed and condescending response you re right that i made a logical leap that i should nt have i assumed that the end of the discussion would be that if people who do x are inconsiderate asshats then we should nt allow them to do those inconsiderate thing if that s not the case then i do nt necessarily disagree with you i just think that people have the right to be inconsiderate because some thing bother different people to different degree edit glanced back and realized why i made the assumption that you would advocate banning the practice you said something along the line of that s why we have noise ordinance i think my logical leap wa more justified now
NONE correlation not being causation is half of it the other half is to point out that individual differ maybe your sister would be happier a an atheist than a pantheist maybe she would nt but there are certainly people who would be happier a atheist there s a reason doctor do nt prescribe the same drug to every patient even if they have the same disease personally for example i do nt think it would make me happier to believe in a higher power whatever that would mean to me because i do nt believe in belief in the sense that religious believer seems to use it if there s something i would like to believe that i do nt have evidence for i just do nt believe it if i did and recognized it i would be fairly agitated it doe nt give me peace of mind to have a belief i recognize is not supported it just give the sense of being a passenger on the titanic with the captain saying that nothing s wrong i do nt think this is representative of everyone just of people with similar belief and personality a me but for people with these belief and personality why would it be psychologically damaging to not believe in a higher power
AH oh gosh you got my number there i could nt have possibly seen someone picking up the most obvious pathetic and short sided thread in my post and yanking on it desperately a though it would lead somewhere that s why i didnt include a paragraph like this none of these show are above reproach of course if that s what you re trying to get at always sunny in particular i almost stopped watching after or episode featured rape joke that i thought were in very poor taste but most of them when they delve into race gender sex or other touchy subject do so with an interesting and inventive angle and all of them are written by people who i know for the most part are inteligent well meaning folk with solid understanding of the issue that their comedy address so it s ok if they make a mistep or two gosh i wish i had the i might have been able to retort with something like there s a difference between racial and racist and if you ca nt tell them difference then maybe you should let the grown ups who have done their homework talk but i didnt include a paragraph like that too bad
NONE so there is a few thing about people they are nt mindreaders more outgoing douchy men who do nt care about what other people think of them will make more move on woman hence they will be in more relationship short or otherwise than the guy quietly nursing his beer in the corner people like excitement there is a reason why most game and novel focus on the role of the hero instead of the hero s tax accountant people do nt know what they ve got till it s gone that s pretty much true human really easily get used to situation and when they lose their novelty they become part of the daily routine this applies to everyone i do nt see how this follows to your conclusion though i do nt really see what this ha to do with anything people smell insecurity hell i and all of u in this topic can smell your insecurity all the way through the internet this is not meant a a personal attack there are plenty of thing i am insecure about in my life and yes not having a girlfriend at the moment is one of them i wa not entirely sure where i wa going with this but it made sense when i started typing this paragraph and i have faith in my own judgement from a minute ago
AH i ll point out how off topic you are at another time no you do nt tell the woman to move on emotionally if you can read you will see that i say physically move on from in your analogy the woman would be expected after year to have physically moved on eg get a new job maybe move back home start a new relationship that is not uncommon for people in any type of extreme stress physically it s time we start working on a new approach to induced terrorism that is not emotional anymore
NONE i would nt worry about nike i doubt they care about you however i think actually going in to the store and taking the humiliation of swapping them like that make it not worth it you could just return and then visit another store come back at a time when someone else is serving but this is a lot of effort to replace shoe which are already quite new and probably do nt need to be swapped also you will have to go through yhe period of discomfort again where you wear in the shoe which can be painful on toesheel
AH you re just an idiot
NONE you re absolutely right
AH dude you re a racist i m sorry if you do nt think you are but you re like very objectively a racist you can delude yourself all you want but i m pretty sure that anyone with the ability to read can see the reality of that i mentioned daca because it s a policy i agree with and do nt understand why people do nt agree with specifically because most people who do nt agree with it seem to like everything daca stand for helping people to help themselves i did nt mention it to give you a chance to spew antimexican rhetoric out head back to one of your rally
NONE i do nt think there s much to debate here if you do nt like a group then leave them alone do nt ridicule them it s a pretty common view we may not agree with their way but i do nt think anyone is actively against it unless they had a unique experience from a psychological perspective i think it s something interesting and worth exploring people have fetish and preference and strange belief for a reason some want to fit in some actually believe it others just want excitement but something in their life led them to these strange group and i think that s worth looking into
AH you just do nt get it it s like you do nt even know what i ve said this is probably the most inane thing i ve ever read in my life you re basically exactly where you started you have shit reading comprehension if i reply it s going to be the same shit i ve already said because you ve brought nothing new to the table this is literally a reimagining of your first post you ve said nothing new all you ve done is highlight the fact that people would rather adhere to the idea that everything is nothing rather than something moral aesthetic any relativism they can get their hand on is more precious than any progress we could make with an established objectivism i already replied to your first post if you want to have a masturbatory circular back and forth where the other ha no recourse but to refer to subjectivity then you can probably have an equally enriching experience by talking to a wall forget about me forget about you just focus on the subject the prevalence of the egotistical element in discussion like these drive me insane having to revolve around who is right and who is wrong a opposed to actually discussing the semantics and the content is something you normies will never understand it s not who is right it s what is right
NONE thanks rand herself called libertarianism a greater threat to freedom than modern liberalism so i do nt know why her view keep getting propped up a speaking for libertarian i did it because i personally know a lot of libertarian who wo nt shut up about being libertarian and also about ayn rand but point taken we ve already agreed those people s loudness should nt be mistaken for representativeness so you hear some term that do nt impact you emotionally and you stop listening that is what i would be talking about honestly it depends on how much energy i have to spare it s a heuristic it s right more often than it s wrong i use it if i do nt have time or energy otherwise i try to pay attention to the meat and your quoted term are more meaningful though i personally disagree with some of them the point i m trying to make is there s a way in which personal freedom a a construct ha emotional impact to you that it doe nt to me it doe nt mean nothing to me but the oomph i get from it is minimal when it s in competition with a compassion value it ll lose i definitely am with you about spreading the message that an ideology like libertarianism ha more in common with people s own value than they may think but to me being libertarian ha to do with valuing liberty in a way that lot of people do nt
AH have you never heard of haes seriously try to be educated on this stuff first
NONE completely agree dude wa going to make this exact post but you covered it all already
AH that s because you are a mental weakling with no argument
NONE there is no such thing a genderfluid it s made up for attention
AH can you read jesus christ you re either trolling or you re a fucking dolt
NONE were you breastfed op how long for it sound more like a disconnection at your end
AH the combination of a watered down updated definition of nazi validity of being labeled a nazi by association virtue of being closely associated with nazis justification of violence against nazis words you put into my mouth creates a complete and coherent package of fascist authoritarian political violence from supposed anti nazisfascists you why are you a nazi apologist why do you hate america
NONE it s a practical solution to what problem the problem of conflict between the two or the problem of relative harm that one doe v the other besides hating on religion atheism pose no harm to society whatsoever but religion ha proven many time throughout history to be a source of tremendous harm from science denial to fundamentalist violence if you re merely solving for the problem of peaceful coexistence i think that s an unassailable position
AH checked your posting history socialist whackadoo confirmed
NONE sure he s been told to by someone whose opinion he value
AH nerdiest antigovernment rant ever did you wet your pant when bluray became the standard over hddvd too i never said the government created the internet and handed it over in a pretty pink bow to industry i m saying government can take on big project that do nt require justification on a quarterly earnings report and that s how you get fun stuff like the internet and gps and the interstate highway system mmkay
NONE i agree with a lot of the other comment in this thread perhaps the punishment doe nt fit the crime why not just take all their asset away all of it perhaps if they think it s cool to take money from people by pulling the carpet out from underneath them then they should know what it feel like rich powerful buisinessperson one week penniless broke the next i think that s a better punishment than sending them to prison
AH you should apply to work for ctr if you do nt already people are getting paid good money for posting topic like this sure they all got doxxed last night but it wa probably all worth it
NONE illegals are normally taking job american wo nt no matter how many time i hearread it i will always hate this line there is no job american wo nt do providing the pay is good enough

AH you sound like a pussy plain and simple
NONE sound good to me your view is coerect
AH did you not pick up on how i wa quoting what you yourself wrote to someone else and then you call me rude they re your word saying public sector job generate positive externality not captured by market force is just a different way of saying they produce nothing of profit generating positive externality is not the same thing a generating cash money and generating cash money is what result in high wage you re really doubling down on the stupid here what do you think not captured by market force mean and why this might be relevant to public sector work i take back what i said about you knowing a little bit of economics since apparently you did nt even get through the lecture on externality in micro it usually come up around lecture five or six that you are arguing so forcefully with so much confidence about a subject you know so little about is fairly impressive please do nt respond lol that s not how this work you do nt want a response stop responding
NONE i see that you have also stated elsewhere in this thread that you do nt care about moral do you really expect in good faith that your view can be changed this is like saying cmv i should nt want to not be a conman and legally scam old people out of their money other people will say that s harmful to society and make you a bad person and your response is basically well the effect on me positive i do nt care about the rest of society also it s only a few old people losing their saving the effect on society is negligible your argument presupposes that i care about being a good person good is just a social construct anyway wellyeah i guess that s logical but it s also trivially obvious it s odd to me that you re acting like you re making some good point saying stuff like edit still no delta at least include in your cmv that you do nt care about other people and you do nt care about moral this honestly seems like a waste of everyone s time
AH he absolutely is in it to win it admittedly since only about late june early august or so when his campaign really took off he may have been a vanity candidate before that point though probably not but in any event this is definitely no longer the case do nt listen to this other fool he ha no idea what he s talking about ps if you want to read some very interesting coverage of trump s campaign and political brilliance i highly suggest reading scott adam s blog series about trump
NONE i do nt think it s too surprising that these type of study pop up in popular medium too they operate on the same bias the number of people who will read an article about feminism is generally higher than those who will read an article about evolution hold up i ll find the lecture http wwwyoutubecomwatch vnnnighgfa i m pretty sure it s this one but the series is worth watching from the start anyway fascinating stuff this is how i would say evopsych should be done sapolsky s pretty good at this stuff plus he rock the beard
AH did you fail reading
NONE no you do nt did i do it
AH you have convinced me your complete disregard for statistical interpretation and wonton use of them anyway ha led me to believe we need stricter statistic control perhaps a training course in college or a background check of your high school class would be enough
NONE if a law is generally not enforced i do nt really think the number alone would affect too much change besides we can have creative enforcement strategy eg we can encourage people to take cellphone picturesvideos of offender and send those in for of the fine
AH but many of those travesty are still current for example guantanamo bay the iraq war or many others i m not a marxist and abhor the ussr and many other socialist nation so even comparing my view on the u to them is idiotic and ignorant
NONE i do nt think the view can be changed at least not here seeing a most of the reply prove your point people in general have a terrible understanding of marxism communism and socialism including most of the comment to your post
AH i believe op is a men s right activist and is lying he is posing a an undocumented immigrant in order to stir up trouble

NONE i think using mlk a a justification to be a jerk make you a jerk
AH full disclosure for those reading this is a post by a radical feminist who doe nt believe in the existence of trans people and is part of a known hate group here are some sentiment she s felt like sharing this make me livid her parent and doctor have deemed her male but what doe that actually do it strip her of the right to experience her body a it really is to experience herself a she really is it could put her at serious medical risk if she ha a medical emergency and the doctor doe not realize the letter under sex on her birth certificate or driver s license is false not to mention no one is even sure what using lupron on young girl actually doe to their body long term all because boy must be one way and girl must be another and one who fails to live up to the categorization must be categorized sterilized if they re female and assimilated at any cost no matter how young or how small the transgression make me sick said about a young trans man no we would not be surprised actually we are well aware that along with trans men that fetishize femininity and womanhood there are also men who adopt edgy or feminized gender identity for the purpose of gaining more access to woman hello jessica hambrook or even try to imitate butch lesbianism which is impossible for any man let alone a trans one apparently trans people are trying to infiltrate her sick little hate site full disclosure we do nt give a shit we just want people like her to stop denying others right hilariously she denies there s any difference between gender at all which would invalidate her entire study but she doe nt care like most devoted to the ideology of hate she is incapable of she is the moderator of rgendercritical a radical hate subreddit devoted to dehumanizing people and attacking those they find different you are reading post from a sick sick individual
NONE i feel compelled to note that you re not bringing up an issue that is completely unseen by the movement you listed but perhaps you have only been recently exposed to it i hate to use the you re young card but well you are a bit young this is nt a new discussion though you presented your argument admirably i hope you will keep your mind open to feminism because fundamentally it s about equality for all not to beat men into submission that s why feminist are trying to fight for increased paternal leave men should nt be viewed a a meal ticket for their family they should have the right to stay home and care for their baby to the same degree a the woman men should feel that they are nt going to damage their career by putting their family first with regard to the abortion question you re right that it s biased in the interim but a man doe have equal right with the woman at the time of sex it suck that it s a bit slanted but then again you re not the one who ha to grow a friggin human inside yourself for month and completely physically change your body and risk your life to do so religion doe have a bearing on why it s immoral to pressure woman to have abortion a well the profound secular moral distress potentially suffered by the woman abortion is a taboo topic for a reason despite in woman having one in their lifetime for some it s a vitally painful experience the worst regret of one s life but not for all a a man you can protect yourself by wearing a condom every damn time just to be sure also i would recommend not having sex with crazy clingy woman there s nutjobs in all gender but it would seem prudent for you to be selective about who you go home with woman have to do this too but we have the joy of worrying about actually getting murdered by the guy or raped either drugged violently or both
AH say obama ha a different view on abortion a everyone else in the party while we know that s not true i m just using a big issue a an example and a voter s main concern is abortion right they may vote for obama because the d represents prochoice most of the time but in this candidate s case it is nt so the democratic party or a democratic primary would not allow this person to be on a democratic ticket which you are too stubborn to admit to is this the thread you claim to being swayed by once again i apologize for lack of sentence structure or cohesive thought if that s an issue here you can see my mind explicitly deteriorating at this point through my typing probably lol fuck your apology admit your view is not reality a this person is telling you
NONE you re right it is unprofessional democrat believe anyone that lean right is a bigot think anyone that support the nd amendment doe nt care about dead people and think that not supporting hillary is enough to make you sexist there is ample evidence that they would probably think you were le intelligent if you did nt vote the same way or in the same frequency a someone in a position of power a much that a ta really ha you should nt be able to push a political agenda on your class no matter what class it is i would nt wear a hillary for prison shirt to any class that i wa a ta in bringing politics up in any setting where you favor one side especially in a college class is ridiculously poor decision making and ps if you re voting democrat in this election because you like hillary you are a hypocrite
AH holy shit am i glad you re not my dad
NONE i do it so i do nt lose my damn bike
AH a goal post mover like this will likely bitch about them not having white skin if they had left their religion utter trash
NONE it ha to be big if your ally are a bunch of retarded beta retard who ca nt keep sand people out of their woman
AH again educate yourself on logical deduction it may seem like magic to you so i do sympathize the only person who doe not understand logical deduction here is you my dude here is how your embarrassing deduction go i deduce from the phrase enormous wealth a sum of money equal to this is not magic this is logic qed if you can read the post actually said the fault is on you for not specifying because you were the one to assume others would follow your line of thought since you ve already agreed with me that the vast majority of people would understand that is not enormous wealth at least the only conclusion i can draw is that you are telling me that you are incapable of such a basic form of understanding and are therefor a special case and i agree with you you are a special case
NONE none of the thing you listed are issued to every citizen automatically perhaps i did not specify that part or and this is very important free of charge you only get a passport if you re traveling internationally you only get a driver license if you re planning to drive pardon my assumption here but i m going to guess that you and most of the people you know have these form of id and that this is influencing your perception of what is going on i would say you re likely unaware that people do lack these form of id on a regular basis and can not afford the time and money it take to get them we all live in bubble so it s important to understand your own bias here you assume that everyone able to vote should have these thing but it s a baseless assumption and regardless of what form of id people should have the fact of the matter is that they do nt and these law are often explicitly designed to disenfranchise those exact people
AH yes i have one of my best friend growing up wa disabled and one of my cousin is disabled you seem like a right close minded demeaning bitter cunt to be honest with you i m guessing from your last sentence one of those socially awkward type who see s themselves a better than their peer and those around them for some misguided reason anyway that s away from the what the comment are supposed to be about
NONE english humor is about presenting serious stuff like it s petty and petty stuff like it s serious this sketch is a good example of that some people find that english humor is a good way to cope with the atrocity in the world some other people do nt want to cope the same way and i think that s fine if they re offended by it then they re entitled to that and i think it s a good thing for them to point it out
AH face it dude you are an asshole accept it
NONE but yours is not right rhailcorporate
AH you are fucking idiot anyone who need psychological boost from fake karma have low self esteem fuck you
NONE how would you lose your sense of justice for other party would nt you have strong empathy for them a well
AH this is a public comment i am not just talking to you i am talking to what you represent by asking what is the problem of a literal interpretation the common response is usually it scientifically incorrect in almost every way snake do nt talk you do nt make woman from rib blah blah blah but that s beaten to death already what bother me is that a literal interpretation get in the way of better more meaningful interpretation that could actually help people i do nt care if you are nt what i assumed you would be i do nt know you this is a public comment if you ca nt stand behind the archetype you presented with your question then do nt post it and do nt complain when someone attack that archetype if i said what s wrong with killing all christian and someone replied saying tahts fucked up omg you should go to jail blah blah i would nt reply by being a pussy and saying oh harhar i just asked a question i m not really a christian hater hehe that s what is commonly referred to a a cop out
NONE op i agree with you although i think you re kind of cheating by putting that exception in your post your main disagreement seems to be what the person saying smile actually mean by it most of the time i think smile is generally shorthand for something along the line of aww do nt be sadunhappy for some odd reason people seem to like to think of men basically a sociopathic controlling beast i do nt buy the explanation others have given in this thread i think a lot of these people have already decided the people saying smile are bad selfish people and try to twist every alternative explanation in some round about way to be a super self centered action that becomes extremely obvious when they start saying ridiculously antisocial thing like what doe it matter to you whether i m smiling it bother me when others are sad because i m not a sociopath fuck me right http ikymcdncomentriesiconsoriginaljonahjpg the historical context argument is a full of shit a the geopolitics argument being responsible for islamic terrorism and backwards value
AH blm is considered a terrorist group lol wat jfk assassination oh i must ve missed when this one wa solved and pinned on leftists anyone who support or wear a che guevara shirt lmao black panther antifa while some might say this is nt a real group bit a hodge podge of multiple group all hanging out under the antifascist label numerous group including the redneck revolt have made public terroristic statement and threat lmao occupy were looked at a a terrorist group but i do nt think they were actually named a such lol only by right wing idiot ms is an international gang which is about to be named a terrorist group it s considered by some a a left group a it claim to protect mexican and immigrant in america personally i do nt think it should be considered left at all but it also should nt be considered right it s a perfect example of how most criminal and terrorist group should nt be either nobody considers ms a leftist group obviously huge number of muslim depending on who you re taking you they are either considered left or right wing a well a palestine group same deal if you re anti israel your apparently left but if you re anti jew you re right which is obviously insane yeah pretty sure you re just listing every random group you can think of and just calling them left lol
NONE well i m inclined to agree that a far a acronym go it clumsy and excessive let look at the group individually though to see how they might fit in the movement lesbian gay ok they re a given bisexual again sure transgender transexual in for the reason you state queer just an umbrella term for not straight in theory this probably would be the simplest term to group everyone who identified with it together in practise it a controversial term with a lot of history behind it questioning questionable but not straight so i could see how they could fit in asexual a very controversial one i wa iffy about this until it wa pointed out to me that a person who ha no inclination to participate in heterosexual society is often considered or suspected a gay by default in said society meaning that asexuals have been known to suffer similar form of abuse in the form of corrective rape and such so i can see how they might want to align themselves with the community goal ally another controversial one though straight people obviously are nt part of the gay community would someone who participates in say progay community activism not by definition share in the community goal pansexual just a fancy term for bi thats more inclusive of trans people spirit i have no clue about this one so i wont comment
AH what do you mean you re under no obligation you re not under any obligation to do anything you re just being dick which is fine
NONE why would this require a change of view you shouldnt be unpleasant in discussion because the moment you do you lose credibility do you want to be unpleasant
AH friend reddit is not the legal system they have rule but you do nt go to jail for it maybe you get banned but that s about it and who give a fuck if it is in the legal gray zone reddit admins do nt have to follow the law when it come to that kind of shit they can ban whatever the fuck they want including fph and shit
NONE let s face it everyone that want to be a polygamist already is while they do nt legally have multiple spouse it happens regardless just because it s legal doe nt mean anyone is going to jump up and decide to get married multiple time polygamous people already do that
AH hey the adult are talking do you mind
NONE do people even try on this forum or what
AH why comment if you cant explain why im wrong just make me assume you re too dumb to defend your position
NONE nope maybe youd be more convincing if you learned how to use a comma properly but im not buying it
AH you re a complete idiot who s actively supporting freemarket fundamentalism acting a an apologist for neoliberalist hegemony what expert are you talking about it is universally recognised that the premise of trickle down economics is so fucked that every body know it but it s still touted by the establishment a bright beneficial
NONE alright well that s a bit of a different argument is nt it now you re talking about enforcement and the ability of society to instil in these individual what punishment they are going to receive initially it seemed like your position on deterrence wa that it would nt be effective because it s simply not a bad a being in isi
AH first to address your argument it would have dropped to oh ok in theory so the contrast between this theoretical reality and today is great that s a terrible argument second given real inflation going from to actually represents a huge step back for the middle class but it s easily hidden in these number i think it helped stabilize the economy a well but do nt believe for second the middle class is close to where it wa year ago a for your general concern there are lot of reason to vote for trump but sadly the biggest reason to vote for either candidate is the other candidate and they are both the only reason either could win trump is like a sleazy used car salesman he say some ok stuff about trade but lot of nutso stuff too hillary on the other hand is like a political version of a bond villain with a private island or death sphere or something they re both the worst but which one will do more damage i honestly do nt know but probably hillary a she ha the corporate state s full support personally i would never vote for either and beyond this farcical choice i recommend to everyone to either write in go third party or no vote
NONE ok so let me say that depending on the circumstance i actually agree with you that not voting is nt wrong the problem is i do nt think those circumstance obtain in your case democracy is supposed to be a check and balance on how bad government get if you re perfectly satisfied with the government you re getting it doe nt serve much purpose to vote the time when it becomes not just a good idea but a duty to vote is when you are not happy no your individual contribution doe nt mean much but imagine a world where it did really think about it it s not supposed to mean much it s supposed to allow a bulk of the people who are dissatisfied with their governance a way to fix it it s supposed to act a a check and balance against tyranny people that give up and do nt vote when they are unhappy with government are nt serving the purpose they are supposed to serve in a democracy and that s sad because it mean that the only people left voting are one that have a agenda and satisfying the agenda of minority of the people is one of the great risks that democracy hold when too many people start to think that voting is optional
AH okay so you seem to have beef with the order of number sound like a pretty strange form of ocd but i m not a doctor let s move forward that last part is kinda important in fact the and are the most important number there but the post focus mainly on the and draw attention away so let s ignore the fact that you do nt attempt to discount the number in anyway only say they re in the wrong order and let s say that the is all we do nt approve that leaf u with agree with both group that s million muslim agree with the taliban and al qaeda again the same thing happens here so those statistic show u that million muslim believe the attack were justified million fully million mostly and million partially do this make you feel better about the order of the number sorry if i wa being out of context by putting the number in the wrong order to try and discredit these number by saying they re in the wrong order is honestly sick doe the need to stroke your virtue really have it hook in you this much you need help friend
NONE while true it s only people who leave that post their opinion imagine there s an issue that really upset of people but of the rest consider it one of the best part of working there the are far le likely to leave and are nt going to mention that issue if they do you re only seeing the opinion of those who do nt like thing never the people who like them doe it invalidate the claim no but it doe mean you do nt have the whole story and it doe mean you are nt sure that the issue on that board are issue for everyone and you need to do more work to find out if that s true a an example if you saw two poll one which polled random people in the company and asked what do you want to change about the food in the canteen and one which said which is your least favourite food in the canteen both with of people saying they do nt like the chip you d take the first one much more seriously because that had the option of not wanting to change anything
AH i do nt think you understand how this work
NONE i do nt really know how the delta work
AH it s just simple respect and not a huge ask it s like if you have a friend named bernadette and really hated being called bernie out of respect you d go out of your way to call her bernadette it take next to zero effort on your part and mean the world to them so you d have to be kind of a prick to not be bothered
NONE there will always be some that feel the need to rise above their fellow man we can have a paradise and there will always be a part of a person that asks what if there s no fixing human nature when you went hiking and canoeing guaranteed there wa at least one person that pushed to do more go farther and see something new
AH you ever think maybe all black people arent alike that simple and true premise should change your view unless you re a racist and stupid a you seem which would be easy to say if your post title didnt say black culture then try to change that to slumghetto
NONE i completely agree with you subjective experience doe not change reality it doe give validity to gender stereotype because now instead of just being who you are you feel a if you must label yourself to fit into a certain group that also say they feel that way incredibly illogical from my view
AH men far more brilliant that you will ever be did own slave it wa normalized in that society but culture change perhaps in year people will believe that you should be killed for calling anything a highly primitive attitude what is funny is that john adam specifically the guy who speaks about the concept behind the electoral college that you are refusing to read about in the federalist paper did not own slave and thought the practice wa abhorrent if anyone know what is good or not about our system it is not you you are in fact a fool have some humility and educate yourself the best you can or just smoke some pot and let other people think for you do nt try to do both
NONE this is a good response i think plenty of people who stop being religious do so because of the reason you mention i guess within the standpoint of religious story and depending on personal philosophy god is nt out to make the world perfect or to literally solve individual people s problem a i understand it part of the idea is that he gave people free will meaning that all people have a choice to do what they want which sometimes mean the choice to do terrible thing people crucified christ in the story anyway so when it work for people i think it give them the personal strength to help push through tough time just to think he s out there and he care even if he s hand off
AH because whats the point of doing a then never following up on it alqaeda had the funding and manpower to do more and there ha nt been any we know that if allowed alqaeda would of hit the u again we know it s not a materialsman power issue or a lack of will in real life there are nt proof for thing because you dont have perfect information asking for perfect logical without a doubt chain of event on thing is batshit retarded and frankly impossible at best you can say is that thing are most likely caused by something else not a single mass shooting not a bus hijacking random car bomb anything sure we have random lone wolf type but one that are the brainchild of main line alqaeda none honestly you sound like the retard that keep repeating correlation doe not equal causation on every single study it doe nt mean anything because it s almost impossible to link causation in the way that they are asking for
NONE this implies a third perspective which is not involved in either side of the controversy which i hinted at by alluding to the personal individual basis but maybe i could phrase it better a disinterested party so the people who do nt care and more or le by definition are nt a informed or affected by the income should decide thing for what reason exactly i say it is not possible to do so and that when traced back all of the premise originate in half truth and unstable condition therefore better to leave it all all thing being equal all thing are definitely not equal that s the point you re getting rid of all debate on a topic meaning basically nothing will happen from a philosophic standpoint you make some sense but from a practical and feasible standpoint it doe nt matter we need to discus thing and figure them out at least the last two thing you mention in your title have always been and essentially always will be debated there s no way around it
AH we re not talking about iphones we re talking about alleviating the ail of those who ca nt meet their basic need it wa a random example of a physical good do nt mount your moral high horse when you re deliberately misinterpreting me we live in a time and country that ha the least relative scarcity of living essential than any other time or place ever before on earth and this will only continue to extremity you re still mixing terminology you re using a colloquial definition for scarcity and then acting like you re discussing the economic definition living essential in the modern u are extremely abundant but they re not nonscarce in economic term it still requires considerable human time effort and resource to produce them and that is the point of economic scarcity you ca nt just pull even abundant resource out of thin air somebody ha to spend their time energy and resource to bring them into existence and they re not going to do that for free the inability of our economy to fill the essential need of those who do nt have wealth is becoming increasingly artificial we already make effort to provide via redistribution to these people alleviation to their economic ail a abundance and productivity grow so too doe our capacity to provide increasing support to them ubi is one such measure that is being considered i m curious is english your first language you write with near perfect fluency but there are distinct pattern you use that are unusual like alleviate their economic ail if you were a native english speaker i would attribute them to being a pompous jackass with a thesaurus but i wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt
NONE money is nt real it s a useful fiction we all agree to that s a whole nother thread someone s ability to support themselves and their child financially therefore is not a measure of their fitness in life but their fitness in economy which is artificial and situational imagine you were in a position in your life where you felt like having a kid along come a new robot and make your entire industry and profession obsolete you re going to be out of wellpaying work for much longer than it take to make a baby while you retrain should the government be able to say nope sorry no welfare for you unless you abort your fetus finally in any free society bodily autonomy is the most essential vestige of freedom and reproductive right are the most primal form of bodily autonomy we have next to eating and breathing we are far far from actually needing to ration resource if it were nt for the individual freedom to hoard wealth in the first place it s nonsensical to preserve the artificial freedom to hoard wealth and consume vastly disproportionate resource to one s need while simultaneously restricting a primal right for people who use relatively little resource by comparison that person living on welfare and having baby we do nt actually need them to do anything we do nt have work for them there is nothing that need to be done that is suffering from lack of worker that would pay enough to get someone off of welfare so i understand the idea of fairness that might spur an opinion like this cmv but a far a unfair thing that your labor support go this is way way way down on the bottom of the list of need to be addressed
AH huh where did you get that i strongly suspect troll but i ll answer anyway you desperately misinterpreted the sentiment i wa saying that our crime statistic are based on arrest and the police force in some area where we can measure like drug use drastically skew arrest statistic such that black men and woman are arrested for drug crime at a much higher rate than white people despite and this is the important part white people and black people using drug equally if it wa a completely egalitarian system white and black drug user would be arrested equally but they are nt not by a wide margin i have no idea how to respond to your question because it is a complete nonsequitur to my point i just think you misunderstood my point or i am misunderstanding yours
NONE i m defining racial prejudice a the kind of adverse judgement based on race formed beforehand and not based on fact let s say you re the police and you re responding to a liquor store robbery but on the way there you see some black dude a block away if based on their race you decide that they must be guilty due to their close proximity to the crime scene you might wrongly harass them or worse similarly if you encounter a black person with weed you might decide that this is just the tip of the iceberg he s got to be doing worse you might arrest him in contrast if you counter a white person with weed you might think oh he s just a kid i do nt want to ruin his life over something so small this is the kind of thing that lead to disproportionately more black people service time for drug than white people
AH you do ask for source when someone consistently make extreme claim on topic that humanity still are nt done researching on matter concerning animal psychology and biology fuck off you troll
NONE i think your basic problem is that you re solely focused on right while the feminist you re talking to are focused on thing that affect people s ability to freely exercise their right like cultural norm
AH when did i state that my position is that people should have to prove that they are capable of raising a child before they are allowed to have one that wa the first sentence in my post here another quote from me in our conversation there would nt be any who get pregnant before passing the test the reducing i mentioned wa reducing the amount of child abuse not the number of bad parent the amount of child abuse is directly related to the amount of bad parent and you have nt prevented bad people from becoming bad parent do you know what would happen in this scenario the same thing a what happens with immigrant today the immigrant is under the law of this country their child care standard must reach that of this country or social care will get involved so yeah uh oh they better learn quick like they already have to do under the current situation so you have nt done anything you ve sterilized your entire country and given them the key to their nut back after they pas your test again you ve prevented nothing the bad parent who are smart will pas the bad parent who are dumb will not child will be abused they will need care you have not done anything but fiddle with the number so it look nicer
NONE a the title state i believe that one parent out of two should have to devote their time to raising child through early childhood and to a lesser extent until they reach adulthood how do you enforce this they ca nt have a job what if the parent have job that do nt intersect what about if parent have stay at home job what about baby sitter what about the hour they work what about the income of the family what about switching between parent becoming dependent on the other can lead to divorce because the other may not want to be dependent or have to work for the sake of the other if they have a child doe this mean that one of them ha to quit their job will this mean that company will be rightfully able to lay off mother who become pregnant doe the government arrest mothersfathers who work is there a fine i know it seems like a good idea to force people to do thing that you want them to do and in today s america where authoritarianism is the answer to everything i know it s common to come up with this solution but it s not the answer a better way of dealing with this is the focus on family staying together the information that we have show that single mother raise criminal and so demotivating divorce or demotivating having child might be better we should focus on those problem rather than trying to punish not being around your kid when there are reason when you might have to
AH well then there s not a lot to it your view are bigoted at best
NONE but ha your view been changed re whether or not it s hypocritical
AH that s some deep indoctrination my friend i pray for your soul
NONE that is precisely my point it sound like you changed your view
AH i would like to see some source about the bone breakage muscle tear rate you are claiming that is literally the first time i have ever heard such a claim you ve seriously never heard of the fact that testosterone is directly related to muscle mass and bone density how old are you http wwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed http wwwwashingtontimescomnewsaugarmystatsshowthatwomenareinjuredtwiceasof http wwwcsameddarmymilfiledownloadpublicaspx docidbdacdbdeabef yayyyyyy female soldier he he a for the efficacy of coed group i find it hard to believe that literally every other business in in the country ha found a way to work in a coed environment yet our armed force are somehow incapable of overcoming this hurdle newsflash working at kinko s is different than fucking war the only thing relatively close to this setting is the police force and this is the stone cold reality of working those job http wwwyoutubecomwatch vkxqdzaawfw when your on the battle field and your hear the blood curdling cry of a fucking girl what the fuck female pow s yeah what a great concept for the upcoming future im done you re a lost cause congrats woman get killed in the military now and unit are weaker awesome job ansuz really changed the world
NONE morpheus for the longest time i would nt believe it but then i saw the field with my own eye watched them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living neo politely excuse me please morpheus yes neo neo i ve kept quiet for a long a i could but i feel a certain need to speak up at this point the human body is the most inefficient source of energy you could possibly imagine the efficiency of a power plant at converting thermal energy into electricity decrease a you run the turbine at lower temperature if you had any sort of food human could eat it would be more efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to human and now you re telling me that their food is the body of the dead fed to the living have nt you ever heard of the law of thermodynamics morpheus where did you hear about the law of thermodynamics neo neo anyone who s made it past one science class in high school ought to know about the law of thermodynamics morpheus where did you go to high school neo pause neo in the matrix morpheus the machine tell elegant lie pause neo in a small voice could i please have a real physic textbook morpheus there is no such thing neo the universe doe nt run on math this dialogue is from welcome to the real world by eliezer yudkowsky
AH so you re ok with killing baby but have no house and you re an idiot wow some logic you have here
NONE wow i m stealing and using now thank you i m always looking for hard data this is it teach me your way
AH no if you voted for trump you re demonstrably retarded hrc lost cause nobody showed up to vote dnc just need to get someone that can galvanize enough of the rest of the intelligent population to vote i think his name rhyme with ernie flanders
NONE a big part of the reason why we punish successful criminal more is because it incentivizes them to stop if someone is holding you at gunpoint for instance you ll be more likely to talk him down if you remind him that he ll be worse off if he go through with it
AH maybe im wrong im sure being a foaming at the mouth prickly pear that shove their opinion down other people throat is very appealing it worked great back in salem so continue on
NONE that s good mean that you hopefully hav nt been eating a lot of it usually it s right near the skin it s not a part like a stem or a bud but more like bruising on an apple
AH republican are being slimy with their choices argument and most of their position reflect their overall attitude that everything should be run by rich christian white men and everyone else should just get out of the way only someone who ha never actually talked to a conservative could believe something so patently ridiculous you need to get out more
NONE the point is not about you being shitty or not but about the fact that everyone have their own conscience and sharking can definitely be consider a amoral for many if you acknowledge this then you have to acknowledge that many people would not shark if they got the chance unless you re believing that all human are ready to throw away their conscience for a few dollar
AH if that is what i said it would have been ridiculous and it would have been really convenient for you but i did nt so let s not pretend i did k thx love yas byeeee
NONE i mean you re sort of right but i could nt give a fuck fuck pedophile the hivemind will always be against this deal with it you have been tagged appropriately
AH honestly just shut the hell up you make a massive fool out of yourself
NONE cmv you never cease to amaze me with what people give a shit about
AH oh lookie here we got a genius amongst u believe everything the cia say you keep going you really think they are nt doing stuff in the background ofc they say stuff like that they want ppllike you think it doesnt work and therefore they dont do it
NONE no i really do nt think it d count it s certainly enough green but it go against the spirit of consciously remembering the day and donning something special accordingly then again i doubt these guy are coming to the pub in their work uniform anyway
AH sex not gender and it s not even true for sex what is the biological definition of woman and why doe nt a postop transexual fit it a woman is a human being with the female chromosome who wa born a girl went through puberty and grew to be a woman they have ovary egg a uterus labium etc i m sorry the public education system failed you so hard that i m giving you basic biology lesson in a reddit thread well that s the biological basis of sex and you deny that sex and gender are different this portion of the argument is about what gender is since you do nt seem to know i m sorry i do nt tie into the gendersex leftist ideology although it would make my life so much easier than dealing with people promoting mental illness transgenderism is not a mental illness yes it is it is gender dysphoria
NONE the whole point of ftn is that you the presumably hetero ci male observer are not the center of the universe and your feeling about breast whether sezualized or not are not a reason for a woman to cover up it s not that they are or are nt sexy to you or sexy to society it s that your feeling about them is not relevant and do not change what the woman should do saying they are not sexual is not saying you should nt find them sexy it s saying dude that is not the point a woman is walking around topless for whatever reason she want just like a man walking around topless maybe it s hot outside maybe she want an even tan maybe she doe nt like the way a shirt feel any number of reason that are not sexual and not your business that s what desexualizing mean your feeling about them are fine it s just that this is not about you
AH yawn tldr got better thing to do than argue with a misguided hypocrite

NONE bill nye should be jailed for his utter stupidity he need to pull his head out of his as
AH you re either a troll or a fool
NONE ca nt tell if serious or troll
AH i m not sure what kind of crack you ve been smoking but a someone who work with climate scientist multiple time per week i can assure you they are not in it for money or glory anyone capable of becoming a climate scientist can work on wall street earn far more money and earn far more glory the vast majority of climate scientist work in that field because they care about the earth the future and about cunt like you who in the face of countless warning backed by insurmountable evidence have the gall to ask misinformed question like this
NONE i agree with you that legally the next few year will probably see stagnation at best and possibly a backslide however the most important gain made in term of identity politics in this country over the last couple decade have not been legal they ve been about the knowledge and opinion of the american people at large i can see people who are bigoted being more brash about it feeling like it s been legitimized but everything i ve seen recently say that a people become more aware experienced and educated about transgender people they also become more accepting and i do nt think that that will stop because trump is president
AH you are an idiot just because you do nt like study that do nt support your position doe nt mean you get to disregard them your proof is not evidence that is how we determine the truth in the world we create study and experiment and try to see what turn up
NONE they still have no say in the design the fed control the supply not the design of the note your initial statement wa that the fed did it you are wrong if you ca nt admit a simple factual error how do you expect people to change your view
AH it is obvious why people do nt say they re proabortion abortion is a bad thing nobody is pro abortion but for many people unwanted pregnancy are worse than abortion so you choose the lesser evil that doe nt make it a good thing and you re being an overly pedantic twat if you continue to insist on nitpicking the actual word being used instead of the idea behind it
NONE i think if someone is caught in the act they should be punished however i agree it would not be easy to enforce otherwise no matter how often it is enforced the face that it is illegal would weed out a lot of good business and make those who continue to do it think twice i do nt like the idea that someone wa tampering with my carhouse no matter how minor it is simply unnecessary
AH yeah your response just glimmer with adult logic and thought any adult with a modicum of rational thinking could have answered your original question in a few second of inner dialogue let alone your followup response you re only partly right i do like to debate just not with troll and child
NONE but then there could be a situation where your false assumption about someone else could drive you apart when perhaps with a little effort you could have come to a better understanding with them you could miss out on informing them or being informed or on some beautiful friendshiprelationshipwhatever purely because of the action of some trump supporter
AH god you re insufferable i ca nt tell if you re missing what i m saying on purpose or if you actually just ca nt internalize it cheer buddy
NONE hey do nt get me wrong i dont necessarily think what you re talking about is immoral or wrong or that it should nt be done just debating the term civil disobedience
AH you do nt know that nothing warrant that behavior you re clearly not taking this discussion seriously only because you do nt have the reasoning capability to keep up i tried to provide with you proof which you dismissed because it suited your argument be an adult and participate in the conversation appropriately please not one line at a time with emoticon all over the place
NONE for instance if they punch someone you have them apologize not a a punishment but because that s what they should do hopefully if you raise your child with mutual respect you end up with le conflict because they respect your rule because they understand them and why they are fair this might be a strategy to employ with teenager but it not going to work with a two year old
AH i guess you have never heard of intentional affliction of emotional distress a tort also defamation slander and libel defamation slander and libel are nt generally about emotional distress defamation especially it s about damage illegitimately inflicted to a reputation it s dangerous to go alone take this http wwwamazoncomonlygrammarbookyoulleverdp is totally and absolutely off the mark their ability to kill their is nt because of emotional harm inflicted on them it s because they have legitimate cause to think they are in immanent danger of physical harm and so are allowed to take necessary action to prevent it i have been reading about and studying selfdefense law for over a decade you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about for one thing your understanding of the english language seems to be very poor
NONE something that ha yet to harm any lawabiding citizen this sound a lot like if you have nothing to hide consequence of spying are panopticism and anticipatory conformity better known a chilling effect http enwikipediaorgwikichillingeffect on people s behavior and free speech people consciously and subconsciously change their behavior to avoid even the appearance of doing something unwanted this can also be expressed in term of the perpetrator government that abuse the trust of their citizen in rich country should nt get away with it we need to have trustworthy government in general i will add that it make sense to prioritize thing that are worse than spying in our politics activism etc and that spying should be at end of our list of thing to worry about but that doe nt mean that it ca nt be on our list at all
AH if the u wa doing what israel is doing currently it would be wrong a well so any country that defends itself is wrong in your opinion give the bully what he want like not being isolated to an open air prison and apartheid that is under blockade or perhaps it s food and medical supply that are simply unreasonable more like the free import of weapon from syria and iran then entrance into israel to use those weapon on civilian you support that i bet and yet here we are israel is killing something like x a many palestinian with a good number being woman and child because of gazan human shield tactic and refusal to make peace stop using human shield and make peace a lot fewer dead palestinian funny how that work you just said it wa legal now it s wrong and illegal using human shield is wrong and illegal attacking a military site that ha human shield around it is legal rebellion are rebellion so you ca nt cite any example of jew in poland acting in the barbarous murderous way palestinian have acted in the past year thanks for admitting it obeyed the rule of war that s a joke right no it s not cite when the jewish guerrilla fighter in poland broke the rule of war i ve never heard of a case where they did and how would polish jew in poland manage to kill german civilian why would german civilian be in poland during occupation how are palestinian gaza in gaza managing to kill israeli civilian when there are no israeli civilian in gaza critical thinking is nt your strong suit is it
NONE west bank dissolve into israel and gaza strip remains connected to the new sinai state and so the dome of the rock one of the holiest site in all of islam fall under the control of the israeli and you think this would lead to a more peaceful middle east in fact if you can change my mind that the twostate solution can happen with both party mutually agreeing to it i ll scrap this solution that s not the point the two state solution might not be viable but this is honestly worse because it is not viable you re evicting the palestinian from their land and ceding control of many islamic holy site to israeli government with the world s blessing israel wa nt funded by the un they were funded by the wealthy jewish diaspora who wanted to aid the foundation of israel a i said earlier there is no such source of funding for the palestinian are you honestly saying that living the middle of the sinai desert is preferable to living in jerusalem or ramallah or nablus it s true that their territory would increase but this http wwwsinaidesertfoxcomwpcontentuploadsjebelberqaviewjpg is representative of essentially all they would be getting in what world is that an upgrade you think you can coax them out with promise of equality but what use is equality for them if they re going to scratch a living off of the sand of the sinai you re kidding right the israeliegyptian border security problem have been an issue for decade the war on terror is only year old in september
AH well you should mention which game you dolt
NONE yeah well you know that s just like your opinion man
AH you re not from conservastan so where you are from is nt relevant to the discussion that would be relevant if you were talking about how we needed to get aa for people from unrepresented geographic region but you are nt you are hypocritical on many front since historically the neonazis outnumber the potheads we fire more conservative than liberal and our workplace ha ended up more liberal than our hiring would suggest rarely have i seen a more incoherent thought expressed to call it a thought is generous it s not even vaguely addressing the point i made conservative complain that they are being discriminated against because of such firing but since being an asshole to customer is not a federally recognized protected class we do nt have to take that seriously in future please address the argument i ve actually made not those made by unspecified others til every country without capital punishment is in anarchy europe australia most of latin america all anarchy your lack of reading comprehension remains stunning i did not argue that lacking capital punishment is anarchy i said the argument you made is only consistent if you are an anarchist
NONE well protest party have got to be do nt they their support thrives on pointing out bad thing about society and then blaming it on something about the status quo for ukip this mean saying being in europe infringes on our sovereignty leading to mass immigration and unemployment it s a seductively simple idea and i think it s worked because it buy into assumption people already had about immigration you re right it ha nt helped at all that meps are not very visible to their constituent and do nt really seem to be that transparent but i think that s only part of the story these are all point that are easy to rebutt though if meps do nt seem visible we have to explain what they ve done what law have been passed and why that s good for u if people blame europe for their unemployment we have to break down the assumption that more immigration le job and explain that immigration creates wealth through tax and that immigration is being used a a scapegoat to hide the fact the government is not investing any money in education or the economy if we do nt engage in these argument though ukip s message will only get more popular
AH well you sound like a fucking idiot whatever your ethnicity if you dont want to be an american than feel free to leave we dont need whiny bitch but we are certainly welcoming to those who want to work hard and are nt a colossal pussy
NONE i m gon na sound bigoted a fuck too stay away from anyone who is strictly religious unless they live tolerance people who are devout can and will kill and die for their faith they re all scary but an atheist muslim is nt going to be a dick to you most likely
AH at what point did he say that the supernatural ha no effect on the world you need to exercise your reading comprehension
NONE so direct evidence that explicitly demonstrates what you said would change your mind doe nt change your mind you in the wrong place
AH you re clearly retarded i do nt see how in your ignorance you might ve figured looking it up instead of embarrassing yourself on here shooting blank is when you ejaculate either nonon viable sperm i m sure you ve had a ton of experience with the two and yourself
NONE ohh i see where you re coming from now i never thought from a perspective of redefining success i wa thinking mainly of the whole get a job right out of college plan ∆ because i do agree that once they better alter their path and put their skill set to use they can find success
AH you do nt understand the concept of pain you do nt understand the concept of sentience you do nt understand the concept of instinct there is nothing to work with here and i m not going to be your neuroscience teacher really embarrassing i can tell you do nt have a scientific background in anything at least i hope not
NONE it seems like we are both getting frustrated so maybe we can take a step back i understand what you mean with a a i can agree that ’ s true regardless of human but do you understand that you are trying to apply materialism to something not covered by your definition do you think the law of logic are “ being process or phenomeon ”
AH you are really angry that map ha really rubbed you up the wrong way huh you re a textbook example of the dunningkruger effect keep in mind i m a fucking power lifterrunner so i m not arguing out of ignorance or bias here ah a broscientist i understand now do you have a doctorate in lifting heavy thing and getting angry at established research i did explain why i did nt really consider writing a rebuttal timeworthy and i think you ve just proved my point having spectacularly missed the point of the map i ll leave you with a thinking point why ha obesity exploded so dramatically over the last few decade if it s all due to people being lazy fat fuck
NONE i still stand by the main idea of my post but i did nt really think about the issue of random accident i wa the one who brought up the random accident thing first so technically that delta should ve been mine hehe seriously though i have my own rags to middle class story it involved a lot of hour day sleeping in my car on occasion and eating so much ramen that i had ramen coming out of my ear p i really do nt think it should be that hard for somebody to get out of poverty esp when you have people like donald trump wiping their ass with bill so even though it s technically possible for someone to make it if nothing seriously bad happens to them that doe nt mean we ca nt make thing easier for people
AH what an abhorrently ignorant statement to make people have passion some of those passion involve greater risk of physical harm than others where the fuck do you get off assuming you know what a person you ve never met wa thinking when he set off to follow his passion
NONE we could have a person who we all know beyond any shadow of a doubt is a corrupt narcissistic cunt and who ha a recording of him saying vile thing that would get most people shunned from polite company and elect that person president i see what you did there
AH no shit these people are nt here to personally cater to someone who ca nt be bothered to read a wikipedia page or two
NONE no this is wrong i m not sure how else to say it church will never be forced to perform marriage they do not want to
AH this post is very cancerous if you re a troll i applaud you if you are nt goddamn it your nation is doomed with people who think like you
NONE no the appropriate reaction is to punch him in the face wtf you know this guy is attracted to woman you know you are not a woman what the actual fuck
AH well i can see the holier than thou crowd is represented cracks knuckles have nt had to babysit in a while so bear with me jesus said word about work yes absolutely the shepherd such a james and paul that you mention said accepting jesus a your lord and savior and having faith how doe one accept a lord and then disobey his teaching exactly i mean yeah we are puny pitiful human and prone to serious misstep but sooner or later you are either walking the walk or just talking the talk and your eternal soul hang in the balance right ha the actual meaning of the word lord been lost on million of people throughout history and come to mean some ascribed title to be appended to jesus or savior i really do nt mean to come off a condescending really but when someone tell me that i must do x y and z i find out the meaning of those word before i agree maybe i chose to not agree so long ago that lord no longer mean what i think and therefore when i used it earlier it wa confusing to those that did nt include obey in their definition
NONE true but i could argue that the father in this analogy is only mortal and therefore can only know his son so well if we are discussing an omniscient god then he would know the son perfectly even his psyche and would be able to recognize that there is no influence strong enough to break the son from his current state or i could take this in a completely different direction and ask why god s omniscience precludes me from taking any path but one perhaps god accepts that when x event occurs in my life he can narrow my reaction down to possibility due to knowing me so well but ca nt know which however god also know what the subsequent result of each reaction are in this way he still know all but he doe not remove my ability to choose it is like the idea of similardivergent universe with god being fully aware of the outcome of every single universe for every single person i mean if we are talking about omniscience knowing everything let s go all out and not limit it maybe that is how it work
AH you were nt a real incel at dumbass
NONE i have dyscalculia i ca nt code for shit

NONE if you still learn about it you are not avoiding it you are lightly engaging with it i hope this change your view on the meaning of avoiding thanks
AH despite their being wrong and their position repugnant failing to vaccinate a child is nt putting them at any significant risk there are nt enough people doing that for it to be an authentic problem it s just troublemaking because you hate antivaccers and would like to coerce them that s the reality here you should change your view because it s literally wont somebody please think of the child a a way to manipulate people to enforce against a type of person you do nt like it s a form of passiveaggression a way to harm an opponent by being overly protective of somebody else falsely it s dirty the antivaccers toe the line of disgust and bad intention by involving their kid but frankly they re not endangering them you should change your view because if you really believe it it s a bit neurotic very high in negative emotion and mistaking that for fact if you do nt really believe those kid are in danger it s a bit psycho punitive very high in feeling of disgust and mistaking it for informative antivaccers just are nt a problem and your perception of a problem is in error if it s factual you need to upgrade your fact if it s predictive you do nt understand how society work or how other people really are we re not vulnerable to the antivaccer movement if it s on high negative emotion you need to not mistake those for information if it s on high traitdisgust you need to realize that society is thriving on sophistication and complexity not purity from symbolic pathogen and cleanliness in other word you should really change your view
NONE it s not about what you have the right to demand from a friend in term of behavior or action it s about your feeling toward someone else and your friend taking these feeling into account with his decision making just a with any social interaction the ultimate goal and thought are likely self centered but we balance our own want with the want of others especially people we care about we say i want this so i should do this but it would make my friend sad if i did this so should i do it the answer to the question is nt an easy one if you care about your friend feeling a well if you do nt care then by all mean go right ahead it s well within your right to do so this is nt really a hard rule a much a it is an extension of an expectation of friendship that you care about your friend and their feeling and thus would avoid doing something that harm them is this unreasonable i do nt think so personally it s a rather basic tenant now you may be thinking but based on this logic what if imposing this rule is being inconsiderate of my feeling and harming me or keeping me from happiness well that s why it s complex and often come with discussion you can definitely submit the argument that i liked her for longer than you did or whatever relates to the scenario in which case the rule would work in protection of your feeling or not at all in case it a zero sum game regardless the rule is never clean or clear because someone is always sacrificing or giving something up but the goal is for the person that want it le to sacrifice since it would harm them le
AH you ca nt even understand me in the slightest apparently unless you are saying you are a conservative who agrees with the current administration in large part or whole if so fuck off not interested get help a i ve been saying
NONE mark twain certainly wa smarter than you so i ll go with his suggestion after all if the world agreed with you there would most likely be someone who asked for more letter to be dropped if nobody stepped up i would for sure
AH this is a terrible post if you re going to write something at least engage him i ca nt particularly be bothered with this argument i suspect most of what you say is a load of rubbish but i ca nt be bothered to prove it mean that you re an idiot do nt get me wrong i m all for staying in the eu but blindly dismissing claim is fucking dumb you should be questioning every one of your belief until you re able to provide evidence for your case i want to see evidence that staying in the eu is good or bad because otherwise it s just people throwing around rhetoric and that doe no one any good if we do have a referendum how are you going to convince people one way or another if all you have are unfounded belief why is a point system important so that we can be sure that the people we are accepting are what we need i would nt be against stopping people with criminal record or extreme opinion in i would nt be against ensuring that people that are migrating in are capable of filling skill gap while i think it s a stupid statement i m also not against preventing foreigner stealing the job of britishborn citizen if only to lower the number claiming benefit
NONE there are lot of thing redditors believe strongly whether it s a political position or just a fact they think they know and are super resistant to change i mean politics and religion are notorious but even unimportant fact many redditors feel superior knowing that napoleon wa nt short for his time point out that the average wa an average of malnourished commoner and that he wa shorter than the nobility he interacted with politically i get heavily downvoted it s not terrible i check whether i got something wrong or whether i just told people something they were nt receptive to if you think for yourself instead of just following the hivemind you will be downvoted sometimes if you are almost never downvoted it mean nothing you say is controversial in the sub you post which mean you are probably not thinking for yourself it s better to use downvotes a a reason to check whether you are right but not take it personally especially if it happens when you are nt in sync with the hive but are nevertheless rightreasonable
AH just because i point out that israel doe fucked up thing doe nt mean i hate jew so basically using the argument used by homophobe of i do nt hate them i hate their actions really strong defense that especially when your top comment to this contains such unbiased statement like all three of the reason for the worst attack in our history can be directly related back to the existence of israel and our support for their war against their enemy in the region that they made by carving a state out of land that people were already living on you worded that in such a way that you separated the existence of israel israel s war and israel s colonization but you re not antisemitic at all right
NONE see this thread i posted two day ago http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentssufcmvithinktheusvsthemmentalityisthe i honestly think i came in writing that because my own personal existential depression started coming back when i heard about what happened in paris now that i ve cooled off a bit i think the only thing we can do is attack a a form of self defense but that s it will attacking do anything to solve the issue in the long run no and that s where i agree with you what we can not do is arbitrarily split up the middle east and set up government ourselves a we have in the past it totally ignores the wish of their own people and make u look like the imperialist boogeyman they think of u a
AH you ca nt take one sentence out of context and then build a strawman out of it the sentence you quoted is telling you that he is going to say what will persuade him for what you said to be true the entire post ha to be missing a statement about what will convince him a i said it clearly is right in there how do you have delta if you ca nt even understand that
NONE he ha power and wealth already odds are that any offer we give him would be le than what he ha now we should offer to get his country to what is seen in china right now that might be the diplomatic solution i mean we ca nt attack without sk getting destroyed a much a i do nt want to agree with bannon he is correct about that
AH there would likely be a genocide of white male lol what you realize you sound a absurd a the sjws do you really think these boogeyman sjws have so much political clout they can start a genocidal movement against the people that hold the majority of political power and who have been in power for hundred of year do you have any evidence that these sentiment are expressed at a large enough scale outside of the internet to be of any real concern it is straight up delusional to think sjws have that much power or even that the majority of them feel that way methinks you ve been on tia for too long
NONE literally losing their job over the result of the election probably not many the point is we ve established that it s possible to have a reason to vote for trump while disliking his character there are probably many other such reason a a result we have many trump voter who are not in favor of trump sexistracist remark and action but believe that voting for him provides benefit that outweigh these downside they re not in sexist or racist and maybe they even care greatly racial issue but opt into a sort of deal with the devil situation to gain something they feel is more important
AH every single one of your point is illogical i bet you think you re a future lawyer asian have lower crime rate because they commit le crime this applies to pretty much every category of crime are you arguing that there is a massive conspiracy and coverup pertaining to asian raping that asian on white rape is more common because of a reporting problem i think you are lying to yourself
NONE so how about i modify this a bit you can inconviniece a single person or allow hundred to die by your logic not inconveniencing that person is indefensible right so why have you not sold your computer to buy food for starving child in underdeveloped country inaction may seem heartless at time but if we are responsible for every bad thing that we could have prevented then everyone on earth is pure evil
AH i mean some form of taxation ha existed in every society i ve said that a few time now how are you this stupid are you sure you re norwegian i thought you guy were pretty familiar with the concept of taxation

NONE the roi is the benefit they create we do nt focus on that we can be selfish and say a an individual my kid owes me but that is nt it if we do not actively engage in our child s learning we re damning u and them
AH instead of addressing my statement you decided that the term i wa advised to use by my tranny friend is a slur and stopped there an adult would confront that intelligently a child would be deterred by language and wait for mommy or moderator to make it go away your view seem to show your tenure on this planet is barely enough to have afforded you the ability to develop your mind for such a discussion of such matter without it becoming distressing come back when your emotional maturity allows you to discus a adult edited to protect feeling
NONE i m going to take another angle and say that the idea that her personal decision affect you when they are something like this is probably should be avoided it is okay for you to have this opinion but enforcing it on your so seems a bit controlling however i think that removing your organ after you die is a no brainer pun intended and should be seen a a logical and empathetic step to death donating organ help other family and other personal struggle opting out denies a body that is no longer living and no longer processing the ability to help an otherwise functional human being
AH nope this conversation is over i ll get more sense out of a bloody stone
NONE no problem if i changed your view in some way would you mind giving a delta
AH pastafarianism is a parody not a religion it is not considered a religion by the u government therefore it is nt a religion and dismisses your argument if you said scientology which is considered to be a religion then you may have a point a most people would not consider it an actual religion edit this is based on the irs it is not what i believe personally if more of you fuck from ratheist want me to define it better religion is a the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power especially a personal god or god it is also a believe in what will happen during the afterlife it s the answer to the question what happens after we die it is also taken seriously by the believer it is nt used a an argument against religion in general though can be used against other religion and is nt a fucking argument
NONE morality definition a particular system of value and principle of conduct especially one held by a specified person or society so morality change based on the society in question there is also the matter of no universal agreement on the morality of god or in other word the view start to break down when you look beyond just a single religion eg would you agree that it s moral to murder someone who is nt muslim a long a it say to do this in the quran or what if someone invents their own religion which state anyone with blonde hair is evil and should be burned at the stake they have just a much evidence to back up their position that theirs is the one true god a anyone else doe so are their action moral i agree that objective morality doe not exist but i do nt see how god and religion are relevant in the matter
AH yo the th amendment make it illegal for you to own someone like you just did ushiningconcepts

AH to the op you re a fucking idiot grow up and stop believing that shit they re telling you in college
NONE ca nt change your view totally agree used to think this when i wa younger but now i know they are just thug for the
AH then you should probably leave because you are clearly incapable of thinking critically or otherwise it would be irrational for a person to walk into a room filled with poison gas to not put on a gas mask it s simply the logical thing to do to protect yourself from a valid constant threat that you have no natural ability to protect yourself from making decision to reduce your threat level is something every girl should be taught from a young age guy should also be taught that there are way to avoid being assaulted there are basic principle at play here do nt go out alone at night stay away from certain area etc you should put your condescending entitled prickishness away and think critically so you can realize that there are real preventative measure to real threat and these thing should be understood and addressed by each person a it applies to them instead of treating woman like they are fool for recognizing that they have a real threat against them simply for being woman also since you like statistic i see you did nt bother mentioning that for example in there were around k murder and k female rape yup they sure do nt have a single thing to worry about do they glad you are on the case both sex should take step to learn basic preventative measure for both rape and murder i m going to take step to ignore any other bullshit out of you however i ve just broken my own rule of getting involved with an internet troll and now i have to live with that poor decision for the rest of the day
NONE i ca nt really change your view since i largely agree with you i m more here just to join the conversation i think the situation where this is most controversial and come up is with rape case obviously rape is a henious crime and is a terrible thing to be a victim of the rapist will always be liable for the rape not the victim of the rape however there is a difference between what is victim blaming here and what is general advice coming from a desire to help innocent people look out for themselves and one another if a person say oh well look how they were dressed they were obviously asking for it and leading people on then clearly there ha been a line been crossed however if someone come and say i m so sorry this happened to you rapist are sick people that we need to do a better job of keeping our eye out and ensuring we all remain safe from the people who are out to take advantage we can do this by ensuring we stay with our friend and not going off alone stick around group and popular safe route rather than going down alley then this sort of individual doe not deserve to be branded a a victim blamershamer if i wa to walk out into the middle of no man land i m going to ensure i wear a kevlar vest ultimately the person shooting at me is the real villain not me for being there in the first place but if i am going to be it make sense to take all the precaution in order to take care of myself it should be expected that people should attempt to share these safety precaution with one another rather than merely ignoring them and taking the risk the world is nt a totally safe place there are situation and people that will victimise you you may not be asking for trouble but you should damn well prepare for it regardless
AH you mean bernie supporter the portland wa a bernouts a well aww sweetie your impotent rage just make this even better i treat people great subhumans not being people are not required to be treated well do nt worry i m sure your little revolution will go well after it s broken over the army and the militia maybe if your cute you ll be kept around remember indefinite detention is entirely legal so putting a few thousand people into camp and forgetting to feed them is lawful in this country
NONE is there some criminal penalty for calling in sick when you re not i m pretty sure insurance fraud carry some jail time it still doe nt change the fact that when somebody take a sick day it ha zero bearing on your sick day also if someone is sick i do nt want them coming into work if someone us all of your proposed yearly allotment of day they re more likely to come in sick when they should nt and there s more of a likelihood that they ll pas it around the office creating more sick people
AH correlation causation dipshit i m willing to argue with you but do nt throw around such blatant logical fallacy and make wild hyperbole of esque thought policing if i am talking to an african person i think it is reasonable to think at the start that they have a lower iq yet are stronger if this assumption hold up over a discussion or interaction is to be determined when you can not inteview or vet every single person it is same then to assume that their race doe dictate certain behavior inside of them
NONE doe it matter i do nt think we can argue against the idea that people do good thing to feel good about themselves but is nt weighing up potential negative vs positive affect a form of morality in itself given how subjective it is for example if i run into a burning building to save someone because i want to view myself a a kind person is that the same a someone giving £ to a homeless person if i am willing to take greater personal risk in order to be a good person if i am willing to do more than the average person in order to be kind doe nt that make me kind
AH nothing personal friend but it is very obvious you do nt have a basic econ understanding you do nt understand supplydemand curve which is very obvious by your food stamp comment i m not trying to call you dumb but economics is clearly not your strength your feeling are nt a substitute for economic reality
NONE you re not wrong in your assessment sometimes suicide can be a perfectly rational choice however the reason you re being told otherwise by your therapist doe nt want you to equate the two whether or not there are rational cause for suicide doe nt really have any bearing on the situation you re in which is almost certainly irrational
AH you gave up with your first response since then you ve been trying to repair your thin ego
NONE if you re trying to cut down on snacking it can help to have a snack that slows you down
AH i did nt ask you any question you came along and told me that i have a fundamental misunderstanding and then you proceeded to tell me thing about the sport regulation which actually support what i m saying then you expressed concern for certain male who might be put in prison with other male but no concern whatsoever for the female who are being put in prison with male you say you are friendly but you do nt seem to care about female while trying to escape from being female yourself
NONE you are the one who titled your cmv i think mother who intentionally gave birth without drug did it for egobragging right when i point out there could be people who do it for other reason you respond with i m talking about the woman who purposefully did natural childbirth and go on to brag about it andor look down upon woman who opted for the drug because they could nt handle it or are otherwise weak so now all of a sudden there s an and in there so which one is it
AH humility is a virtue of all wise men explains why you have none
NONE in what way are you not convinced that these class would be helpful
AH til that university are run by bank if this wa the only thing you could nitpick it s a good thing that the usg can not print money because by and large politician are short term thinking fool but they can loan the same amount start thinking critically ffs it s hard to find example from history where government have not abused monetary control to rack up debt and inflate them away but now that the fed is here we sure do nt have debt or inflation right central bank independence exists to prevent this this is what the pr brochure of the central bank say bravo for repeating it verbatim what i do nt get is how come you stop at the level of slogan like this and fail to observe the reality behind them
NONE i agree with op really what the governmenttax authority advocate do nt understand is whatever service they provide to rationalize that tax the fact is the seller is setting the price and there really is insufficient control in place to keep bad actor from blowing price all out of proportion let s do a little thought experiment if i were to say that the used kleenex i just tossed into the trash can wa worth and furthermore you must buy it or i will throw you in a dungeon for a million billion year then that really could nt ever be called a fair transaction by any rational thinking being could it same thing with government service and taxation hope that help you guy see the light

AH he either belief it or is a troll in either case just move along you ll only raise your blood pressure by sticking around
NONE that still doe nt address that it s a way wipe are not superior to toilet paper whether you ve found a work around or not
AH you re a trolling u right even if you grow up in a bad environment you know right from wrong plenty of black people have risen up above racism and bad environment eg the president if you re going to keep playing the victimized race card you re doomed to stay exactly where you are and the american dream is dead for you in america you get place for working hard not because you re taking advantage of evil inflicted on your ancestor that is absolutely selfish and you re disgracing the legacy of african american slave and their descendant a a whole no one owes you anything this is a debt too late to pay properly a for black on the cover of magazine or in movie make a change if you want a change start a magazine write a movie you are in one of the most privileged country on earth for cry out loud
NONE you re thinking about it wrong it s not an advantage to be a minority in a non minority dominated world of academia nor is it an advantage to have been disenfranchised for multiple generation you re not getting a leg up the playing field is being leveled and regardless of your socioeconomic status or financial situation being a black male ha proven time and time again to be a disadvantage in the classroom workplace and everywhere else for that matter not to mention i ca nt speak for admission but in human resource field nonanswers to race question are treated a white do you want another race to take credit for all the hard work blood sweat and tear you ve put into getting the mark and test score put down black and know that you re proud to represent your race a an applicant at the university edited for typo
AH you confuse transgender with gender dysphoria here for trans people without dysphoria there is typically no incentive to change and psychiatric manual recommend against any transition if the patient doe not experience dysphoria from the current form whoosh what i m saying is that the gender identity of someone who is not dysphoric is not relevant it is the dysphoria that make it relevant not the gender identity and there are even case of people who experience dysphoria without the gender identity stuff right but are you seriously suggesting that people who study this issue only look at people who experience dysphoria or those who have a gender identity that doe not correspond with their biological sex the issue of gender identity is interesting regardless of whether it cause dysphoria or not
NONE let s start here i firmly believe that gender is not a social construct my strongest evidence for this fact is david reimer rest omitted for succinctness i think you misunderstand what people mean when they say that gender is a social construct they are nt trying to say that gender identity is nurture not nature instead they are arguing that the way a culture understands and categorizes gender can vary from culture to culture while you claim that the gender binary of male and female is probably one of if not the longest standing cultural agreement humankind ha historically been able to make there are plenty of example of culture in which that did nt or doe nt apply http enwikipediaorgwikithirdgender consider the hijra of india they are considered their own gender separate from male and female the fact that different culture interpret gender differently is why we say that gender is socially constructed
AH you have no understanding whatsoever of statistic or race relationship and purposefully discount the the opinion of people who are in a far better position to understand these thing firsthand than you will ever be not only that but you make ridiculous unsubstantiated claim and then ask others to substantiate their own claim
NONE i think it s important to always know the difference between being asked to leave your own comfort zone and simply acknowledging that other people s comfort zone are different than yours you can acknowledge the fact that some people have sex without the benefit of a relationship beforehand but decide not to participate in such a thing yourself
AH this is basically just lying to me lying is the act of intentionally saying something that you know is wrong it is not saying something that you think is true but might be wrong so no it s not basically lying anyway i ca nt find the tribe i wa thinking about i know i saw some documentary about it way back but i ca nt for the life of me remember what it wa called but i found something called a koteka it s basically a penis sheath and is worn in some tribe on new guinea while it still cover the penis it only cover the penis not the scrotum and not the skin around the penis it also look like a penis though often very long go figure the same concept can also be found in tropical africa and northern south america it s possible the documentary i saw wa about people with penis gourd in other news i just remembered one somewhat famous culture in which people do nt cover their genitals nudism there are also record of casual nudity a in nonsexual during certain festival a well a exercise in th century bce sparta and of course ancient greek olympic athlete competed naked tl dr i m not lying i might ve been wrong but by definition i wa nt lying some tribe in africa south america and oceania wear penis gourd and casual nudity is nt unheard of neither in history nor today edit also what do you mean that s your point you never tried to make the point that i do nt know if there are culture around the world that do nt cover their genitals you someone else said that no part of the human body is inherently sexy to which i replied that the penis and vagina are inherently sexy but that that still doe nt necessarily mean we should cover them a there are culture around the world that do nt though i ll admit i wa wrong that there are plenty of these you then asked for example you never tried to make a point at least not to me edit a couple word
NONE there is comparing and then there is equating it s not wrong to compare the two if you are focusing on the part that are the same while still recognizing the part that are different i d probably agree that it is offensive to equate them a in circumcision is every bit a wrong a fgm of course it s not but there is overlap and it is useful to highlight that overlap when trying to explain the negative aspect of circumcision to some of your specific point their parent consent for them so there is consent surely there are some scenario where it is morally wrong for the parent to consent for the child sex marriage etc my argument is that cosmetic surgery is one of those scenario yes there are men who consent to circumcision later that should be the norm rather than forcing it on baby it would be even more effective in stopping the spread of sexually transmitted disease if we removed the penis entirely surely you do nt think that is appropriate so we are arguing a matter of degree here i think it s wrong to surgically remove any part of a human being without their consent you think it is okay if it is this specific part why i do think piercing a baby is immoral why is it okay to pierce their ear but not their eyebrow nose and belly button it just seems arbitrary and based on tradition rather than logic like circumcision see above however i do nt think it s our moral imperative to police other culture unless it s a gross violation of human right i m a circumcised man i think it s wrong and i wish i wa nt so much so that i did not have my son circumcised ama here s a quick link http wwwpsychologytodaycomblogmorallandscapesmorecircumcisionmythsyoumaybelievehygieneandstds i found via googling debunking some of the point you brought up the site itself is nt a great source but it doe cite real study
AH nice weasel word unless you can find actual footage of any popular politicans agreeing with it your word mean jack shit nice attempt to deflect though i never talked about how snoop s video could be considered offensive
NONE while i do nt entirely agree with your post i think it s ridiculous that you re being downvoted for sharing your opinion i wonder how many other great and insightful discussion have been buried under down vote simply for being controversial

NONE the point stand that it is possible for one person to have a correct political opinion you state numerous time in your view that it is not possible
AH using your own logic the slave of nat turner s rebellion were only inviting more slavery and brutality it absolutely did incite more violence but comparing the action of desperate slave to dissenting party is absurd on the other hand an ethical utilitarian would point out that historically speaking punching nazi ha gotten the job done few selfaware authoritarian want to follow someone who get their jawrocked which is why richard spencer is nobody now oh wait thats entirely wrong you forgot about the concept of a victim complex and the power it ha why do you think trump is so popular either you accept that a nazi need to be taken at face value or b they do nt really mean what they say and they re just trying to get attention or c they mean what they say but should be fought through nonviolent mean i can only imagine if someone said colt fan deserve to be gassed and wa actively organizing to gas colt fan you might take the existential threat more seriously instead of insisting that people simply wait to see if they have any intention of following through on their promise the direct equivalent would be a bunch of whiny people saying colt fan should be gassed i d ignore them or tell them to fuck off because i dont think they ll ever get government power because i m not a lunatic for the record i have and i will continue to punch nazi hope you do time friend
NONE but black tend to be more vocal in crowd for instance they will speak out in a movie theater or live theater or cheer their approval of their performer midpiece not to mention dressing black which is ground to be shot in florida a for jew it s le the greed stereotype a the loudmouthed pushy lawyer i wa thinking of many jew are embarrassed to see them on the news but they choose to not give a damn but i m still not shaken that it s harmful to make this the norm when the goal is to receive equal right and be viewed a equal but the norm should be act like you want to act if you are nt hurting anyone else why should anyone else get to say anything about it i really do understand what you re saying if you apply for a job and somehow they know you are gay you re concerned that they ll think of the stereotypical flamer and not hire you based on them for instance but i think it s dangerous to say i m not that sort of gay you can discriminate against those freak but not one who can pas like me i think it s the same thing a a lightskinned black in segregation day thinking they re ok or a jew married to a christian in germany in the because when the hater come around looking for target they do nt care about how you act they hate who you are you ca nt give them excuse to hate some of you more than others it s the hate that need to change not who they round up first

AH i should nt bother but i will to make sure you wo nt make such a stupid statement ever again firstly what doe the byzantine empire have to do with the violence of islam also exceptionally violent the byzantine you speak of are the one that have sat on their anatolian region losing piece of land after piece of land to muslim ghazis since the fall of the western roman empire if they were exceptionally violent even though they were definitely not an exception their attempt at violence wa incredibly futile let s humour you and assume they were exceptionally violent doe that have anything to do with the violence of islam ad hominem you made an incredibly stupid point you said that islam wa never violent and that christianity wa more violent than islam christian fighting between themselves are not christian dispute those are dispute between individual not backed by holy text the christian crusade amass to nothing comparing the islamic subjugation of the entire subcontinent of india and the ottoman invasion of hungary and austria we will not even delve into the previous islamic war of holy conquest on region of the balkan and anatolia or the fact that mohammed literally had to siege the city of mekkah away from kufrs doe your ignorance hold no bound so it s silly to say that islam is a violent religion it s not remotely backed up by history it is literally backed up by the quran s own retelling of history when mohammed violently took the city of mekkah from the kufrskaffirs
NONE to be fair that s only confusing because you leave out the fsa what happened wa there wa a popular uprising against a dictator the first major group to rise up were liberal moderate trying to capitalize on the arab spring the u and europe wa like liberal moderate taking over a strategically important nation in the middle east yes please they started bombing the syrian dictator to help out but not all the rebel group that formed were liberal moderate islamic state folk that are spiritual or literal successor to the bad sort of islamic extremist that we ve been fighting organized and basically knocked out the fsa a a group that can take over syria by force of arm we bomb both enemy of the fsa because we still back them russia ha always backed the syrian dictator because they can do business with the dictator and would do much le business with their the islamic extremist or the liberal moderate they have been pushing the whole let back the strong enemy of isi and then politically reconcile then with the liberal moderate they have nt really gotten a ton of people on board with that but unless the fsa really get in good with the kurd or other stronger player and get back in the game then that s the most likely outcome because no matter what political agreement is struck between the regime and free syrian the rebel will need to be able to fight or it wo nt be worth the paper it s printed on
AH where is the godwin s law bot when you need him
NONE did you know that satan is a christian character
AH compared to an event she doe nt remember because she blacked out this is overkill are you saying that a rapist only deserves to be punished properly if the victim is conscious ie you think a passed out person is fair game because they wo nt remember anyway what the fuck is wrong with you in any case this girl had dirt inside her vagina and multiple injury so your whole disgusting point is moot
NONE just for rape or if someone accuses a thief of stealing their wallet and identifies them in a lineup and can be shown not to know the person or have a grudge against them and testifies convincingly but the police ca nt find the wallet or link the thief to it they should go free basically is all you re saying that eyewitness testimony by victim should be given no weight that seems like a bad idea
AH gosh thanks i really needed that explained to me did it occur to you that maybe the view that could do for the most changin is the notion that approaching complex nuanced issue with simplistic overly broad statement of absolute fact is a pointless exercise in jack offery sure maybe op did encounter someone who is nt worth speaking to making the opposite claim that op is making i think it s all the much more important to clearly point out that the antidote to stupid nuanceless arguements that ignore reality is nt more stupid nuanceless arguements
NONE they re only going to make people feel like the world is a far worse place than it really is even if that wa the case it just might motivate the listener to do something about it thus their complaining would have indirectly made the world better and helped solve the problem they were complaining about the main issue i see with your assertion here is that it s based on a hypothetical situation that can go both way sure complaining might just create an feedback loop of negativity but it might be the perspective somebody needed to realize that a problem existed or wa worth caring about
AH you only think like this about boston strong because their team the boston bruin beat your team the vancouver canuck in the stanley cup final in you like their entire fan base are taking the defeat very hard even three year later because you feel you were cheated by colin campbell head of player discipline whose son played for the bruin at the time and indeed still doe let it go it s only a game
NONE year ago i would have disagreed with you but with the big playpasser friendly rule the nfl ha put in play over the past year it s much harder for a defense to stop the opposing team from getting chunk of yardage at a time either by completion or by pi there s no reason a team should nt get a chance to respond to a td i can understand losing the game on a safety but damn man
AH op is a tard who ca nt tell a meme from a published study
NONE a random person above would have been a better president
AH no where did you read that can you read read what you just quoted i said to paraphrase only that it is nt valid to play riskreward with the very rich educated and connected because they do nt have the same risk or at least they do nt perceive the same risk of getting caught that you or i do look i m only here to talk about your third point only to talk about your third point third point third if they did warrant murder the political risk far far outweighs any potential gain i will however say that the argument that a politician would nt have done something because the political risk of getting caught is not a strong one get it that s my whole argument that op s third point doe nt make any sense i do nt know if hillary or bill or trump have ever killed anyone and frankly i do nt care all i m saying is that ops assertion that they would nt have ever killed anyone because of some riskreward analysis is naive how you turned riskreward analysis doe nt prove innocence into the clinton are guilty because of a lack of proof that they re innocent i ll never know but you need reading comprehension help
NONE which is poor reasoning instead of talking with a girlfriendpotential partner about what you feel is important you downgrade a group of people based on an arbitrary fact that may or may not influence future decision sure if the woman is deadset on getting an abortion in the case of pregnancy then do nt date them but make a decision after you have all the information instead of poorly extrapolating from have had abortioncould foresee themselves getting an abortion i do nt feel it d be right of me to make this person keep it just because they started dating me especially if it for medical purpose it not only not good for her but not good for me either since i feel so strongly about it i do nt want to come off a rude but how much experience do you have with relationship i ca nt think of a long term sexual partner i ve had that we did nt discus unplanned pregnancy to some degree or another but i am entitled to my prefered qualitieshabitsexperiencesetc hopefully nobody is trying to argue that the police should be barging through your door because of this nevertheless that doe nt make every preference good for lack of a better word
AH a lack of compassion i d rather call it masochistic selfflagellation on your part yep it wa a war between u but it wa over before our grandparent were born so everybody should have gotten over it by now offensive my as they are called indian stop being so preachy and stuckup sjw type are a collective pain in the as of humanity you kill all the joy in life and for what so you can pat yourself on the back for being soooo compassionate
NONE at some point in everyone s life they must learn of the reality of death and how easy it is for something to die especially death by ignorance i ve seen way to many people and pet killed because some idiot did nt do their damn homework the death of the rabit due to letting him eat something he should nt would start the learning process for both of the above point hell it ll ever say something about excercising restraint
AH i have not changed my view in the spirit of this sub i have explicitly remained of the same point of view a i began and you re the one who ha agreed to my point repeatedly before redacting your position you re taking thing out of context in what i can only assume an attempt to gain delta i do nt give a crap about fake internet point i m here for discussion and debate quit changing the context to make yourself look good you and i are the only one reading this conversation and i know the truth stop kidding yourself stay on topic or stop talking quit arguing ethic when the discussion wa never about ethic or morality stop twisting thing out of context acknowledge the view and point of the other individual and stay on topic quit making up stuff a you go to make yourself feel better learn how to have an actual debate or go comment on youtube where the troll belong
NONE how often do you hear the phrase it s not the s anymore in response to your view on thing like gay marriage sex education and abortion now how often do you hear about it for i want to wait to have sex until after marriage or i am going to church this sunday or i would never have an abortion my guess is the first set of thing get it a bunch more than the second set and the reason for that is the first group is holding your moral code and your belief to people who do not hold those same belief where a the second set of comment are thing that you hold yourself to i am not arguing that you change your belief on how you live your life spiritual fulfillment is very important to people i would ask though that you think about what you were discussing the last few time you heard the phrase it s not the s anymore and think about what you were saying and if your belief were effecting other people s life if you want feel free to share what the situation wa and i ll happily keep conversing response time might be a bit slow though regardless i hope you have a wonderful day
AH that only work if they were found guilty what part of plead out did you not understand poor people being unable to fight against accusation of any crime a effectively a the rich is an issue of class see the difference the kid at duke were not poor they nearly got railroaded anyway exactly so since nonaffirmative consent is the law in state and federally it much more mainstream again no please stop inventing fact http affirmativeconsentcomaffirmativeconsentlawsstatebystate because in those case the victim rarely know the perpetrator which make the whole i tried to pin this on someone i did nt like angle a lot harder in what world do you think people try to pin rape on people they ve never met really you have bizarre fantasy you re still presumed innocent no you are nt to quote from california s law a policy that the standard used in determining whether the element of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated is the preponderance of the evidence not presumption of innocence preponderance of evidence you ve repeatedly demonstrated you have no idea what you re talking about please do nt come back until you do
NONE i do not see any gain for the church if they interpreted that line the way you do yes you do you acknowledged in this post http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsqedithinkpopefrancisisdoingagreatjobaspopecdcks that a coverup benefit the church threatening people who know of childraping incident with excommunication would certainly discourage priest whose friend family and entire career are within the church from speaking out at all that is a coverup honestly it seems like no matter what i say you re just going to defend the church and ratzinger to the hilt even to the point of contradicting what you ve said earlier in the discussion you re trying to spin the unspinnable by splitting hair and drawing new stuff out of thin air i shot down the content of the trial rebuttal so suddenly we re only talking about new information revealed during the trial never mind that that is not what the letter say and not what you were saying before the doublethink and mental gymnastics are incredible to watch but there s little point continuing this discussion
AH ok that s fine there s no need to be immature about it and mass downvote me i m sorry that i espouse a different view then you but is nt that the point of this sub
NONE yay that make me happy some perspective is good for almost every issue if i changed your view could you please award me a delta i ve always wanted one of those
AH how much of this antifa doe nt understand how dangerous what they re doing is a proxy for you feeling maligned for being centerright can i see the argument you got into with a liberal that lead you into making this thread make your accusation or fuck off dog whistle are cowardly at best
NONE your analogy doe nt match your conclusion there is clearly a difference between a joke and being a bully it sound more like you have a problem with arsehole rather than the joke s a friend might make if you are directly the butt of the joke then they clearly are nt your friend
AH would you kindly fuck off with the muslim hunt dude you re beating a strawman to death the op is here to question their view and changed it in fact i m havimg a hard time seeing why you insist this is some quran thing when almost every abrahamic religion ha tried law like this at some point
NONE i fail to see what s racist even in blackface not to mention this i wish world wa le focused on being offended by picture also this reminds me of a book i ve read a a child not sure what the name wa book wa about a society in which knife were banned because knife is a weapon that might kill people

AH go sleep it off kid
NONE so good and spot on
AH so you can win a logic battle to say that technically they have double standard but that s not the end all be all translation oh shit this guy wa right and now i have to pretend it doe nt matter do you think that there is a valid reason to not always enforce your rule without fail irrelevant my only point wa that this wa an inconsistent decision based on twitter failing to discipline everyone who violated this rule including the person who reported milo whatever his name is do you think a valid time to look the other way on something like this is when the person violating the rule is doing so in order to bring attention to their victimization two wrong make a right that s your argument now do you think it s a valid time to enforce the rule when the person violating the rule is doing so in order to victimize someone jones wa violating the rule in order to victimize someone in the tweet i posted
NONE because i don ’ t believe we will ever be able to agree whether abortion is killing a person i again don ’ t think this should be used a criterion for making the decision i think you actually have to solve this issue first before moving to other reason for abortion for two reason would nt reason dictate that we should err on the side of caution if you do nt know if the fetus is a person it would be tremendously amoral imo to say that you might be killing someone but it doe nt matter because it s hard to decide and just sweep that under the rug and move on to other criterion you say we should take into account what is best for the fetus but if you have nt decided that fetusperson then there is no real reason you should care about that the decision of the mother and possibly the father would be the only real important aspect in that case what s best for the fetus only would come into play if you consider it a person so you have to decide that first
AH you ca nt say it ha nothing to do with communism you ca nt think i pity you wrong can be forgiven nothing save the life of those men raped a young boy by their patriarch most do nt what a defense yet your church put them into a position of unquestioned authority even if there wa only you would still be culpable i have i guess i should nt have assumed i meant read and comprehend because you certainly have nt done that you are making claim without providing any evidence for them that sentence doe nt even fit a a response but it is what dogma and inability to think doe to you indeed you re the one with the cognitive dissonance marxism ha nothing to do with reality marxism is about the condition we live in and poverty doe exist even if you only think it exists a a vehicle to get you into your heaven that s why so many are becoming christian many is a relative term many more are opting out or considering it a personal choice not to be imposed on the rest of u marxist never alleviate suffering dogma and i am not a marxist not that you have any clue what a marxist is pastor do nt preach many sermon on the evil of marxism these day different word same dogma anything that keep you subservient and them in power you say righteousness is sick you have no clue what righteousness is all you know is dogma no reason no thought no moral except abusive one go beg your priest for absolution he may absolute you like a husband never could up your as
NONE that might be true for some kid but not all well no pretty much all kid test limit and rule it s developmentally appropriate for them to do so plenty of parent will treat their kid a nothing but a neerdowell hoping to argue their way out of work but i think that s just a immature a a kid treating their parent a nothing but an authoritarian who just want to cramp their style yes treating your kid a a neer do well is categorically bad but that s not what this cmv is about which one do we really mean to impart on the child all of them in different way life s not fair ie i reserve the right to be unfair because the world at large is no it s not that i reserve the right to be unfair because the world is it s that viewing the world in term of fairness is going to lead to endless frustration there will always be another kid whose parent are richer or more permissive or who is smarter or more talented or who winstheraffleforthegoldfishthatireallywantedandtheydidntevenreallywanttohaveandtheysaidtheyarejustgoingtoflushitdownthetoiletsoitsjustnotfair obsessing about dimensional concept of fairness is not good for a kid and it s a lesson they need to learn sometimes you need to do shit just because the person in charge tell you to this is absolutely a needed lesson i ve already told you why i am being fair but you re too young to understand also a good lesson why is it bad they they learn all three
AH this is similar to admitting you have no response very mature of you
NONE i think that is a beautiful wording of the point you are trying to convey
AH i think he is saying that part of that history includes the novel idea of abolishing slavery history class teach about the abolition of slavery so what s the problem also your whitewashing of history saying that only white culture is uniquely to thank for abolition is ridiculous http enwikipediaorgwikilistofafricanamericanabolitionists a for the rest of your comment i m sorry you are offended by me calling out op for using ridiculous term perjoratives have no room in this debate also learn what ad hominem mean
NONE this is the second reply to your comment this blog post should help you out http wwwsamharrisorgblogitemthetruebelievers in it harris say in my view one really can ’ t blame the religious dogmatist for resorting to literalism once he ha accepted the claim that a given book is the perfect word of the creator of the universe because nowhere in these book doe god counsel a metaphorical or otherwise loose interpretation of his word in fact many scripture contain passage that explicitly forbid that kind of reading there you go
AH take yourself down a peg lol no need to act so high and mighty over nothing
NONE we need a new site wahhhh go fucking find it or build it yourself jesus

AH so you re saying it literally better to not even bother you must be an idiot
NONE it doe nt explain why you think that is acceptable but public fund are not
AH nope i could nt think of any wow that s a first we should contact the guiness book of record and tell them we ve found someone that support every single idea there is wait that s absurd it ca nt be true so work with me honestly for a bit let s try just one question at a time ie you can stop after the first question that you have an opinion on are you for or anti abortion are you for or anti gay right are you for or anti slavery are you anti any idea at all
NONE i do nt believe that it is ever right to kill someone i have a gun pointed at your significant other s head or your child s head any minute i could kill them and i do nt care about the morality or ethicality of it you have a gun is it right to shoot me what if my gun is pointed at your head is it right to shoot me selfpreservation and selfdefense is our most basic right if someone presumes to try and kill you it is completely morally justifiable to kill them
AH i know i said i would nt reply but i have to point out just one thing you say my argument is based on opinion it s not i do nt disdain transgendered people although i m beginning to disdain you my reasoning is very clear and simple and you actually summarized it quite well and if people claim thing without solid evidence then they are wrong to do so you mean like a male claiming he wa supposed to have been born a female oh and by the way i m embarrassed for you that i even have to explain this but because they re funded by the government you misinterpreted what i said so badly i m almost convinced you did it on purpose i did nt claim that government funding discredit an organization and you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking something so stupid i wa claiming that you should nt blindly trust an organization just because it is backed by the gov i did nt say that government funding wa evil all i said wa that you should nt blindly believe what the government say there now i am done if you d like to twist around my word and intentionally misquote me any further you ll have to do it alone ironic that you claimed i wa the one making the strawman argument ha
NONE i ve got two argument firstly when you say i think that the intent in which whatever one say something is the core of whats important i think important is fairly ambiguous now i think it s very clear that what a person intends to mean is what they re actually trying to say but this doe nt say excuse someone from being racist a long a their intent wa nt racist because someone s failure to communicate what they intended to say clearly is often telling or otherwise relevant so for example if i say pass the salt but what i really feel i mean is please pas the salt it s plausible that i forgot the please because i do nt really respect whoever i m asking or i do nt value the word please or i m singlemindedly focused on getting salt in other word even if intent is the most important thing it certainly doe nt follow that what you actually say is unimportant secondly you might be confusing racism with being a racist whether or not something is say rude ha very little to do with intention who care if i meant to say please whether or not someone is rude might do however but this doe nt mean that the polite person who forgets to say please ha nt been rude though they might have been they re just not a generally rude person
AH where doe your confusion lie it lie in which of the dozen or so mathematical average you re talking about the average of nine s and one is how many of those number are below what s bigoted about it swampdonkey is a sexist insult it s pretty ironic that you re calling someone bigoted while being a bigot yourself you re choosing to substantiate your argument with this yep first of all you do nt need to have a subsequent solution to be able to point out error but it s a good idea to have a little more than a pithy quip second of all a the previous commenter stated the u is a federal republic and not a democracy it s a democratic form of government which mean the average voter still decides the issue at least in theory
NONE assuming you re an american your black friend ha every right to criticize you for any of your behavior because the right to criticize is codified in our constitution now in this specific situation the race of the person saying the nword is a part of the context think of it like this a poor person might say something like oh it s so hard to buy grocery this week but still get angry if they hear a rich person say the exact same thing the context of the word change depending on who is saying it and no it ha nothing to do with analyzing it in a racist way and it ha everything to do with the historical and current racist usage of the word he is nt setting a higher standard of behavior on you he s telling you that your usage of the word is nt cool and he would appreciate it if you did nt do it
AH fuck you stupid feminist piece of shit
NONE blame misogyny sound about right no
AH this could have been a really really good and well thought out argument and many of the point you make are actually pretty interesting but why do you feel the need to make them in such a bitchy tone while constantly trying to insult me at this point i do nt even think you understand your own argument why would you think that it s necessary to be so condescending about this i would love to talk to you about this more because i really think it could be interesting but i do nt think i will because i do nt need to subject myself to being talked to like this
NONE how deep is deep enough though and how can you personally say for yourself until you ve actually delved a bit and seen how deep it can go an overview might tell you what s within a subject but doe nt really expose you to the practice of it and knowing what you want to do is a much about experiencing the field a much a knowing what they involve i might look at the work of michaelangelo and say yeah i d like to be an artist but i do nt think that s really an informed choice until i ve sat down and tried to do a portrait myself drawing a smiley face doe nt do it i have to feel out my innate capability and be exposed to the challenging part before i can really have a sense for what it mean to practice art
AH you are a moron source read your comment
NONE here s a reality check look matter
AH seriously dude this is getting a little pathetic good thing i wa nt trying to do it for a living i clearly wa nt a good a you s it wa just a shit restaurant that nobody ate at which is why it went out of business in only year i m done talking about this go pick a random fight with someone else about how good you are at waiting table maybe someone else will be impressed
NONE everyone is disagreeing with you so i m here to agree tim curry in clue is perfection i have loved that film since i wa a teenager it s completely ridiculous but that is the point i can imagine that lot of people would nt like it stylistically a it s super kitsch but they re wrong i love it and it s essentially a vehicle for tim curry to be fabulous darling p my wife doe nt agree ca nt win everything
AH for having a controversial opinion you spelled ignorant childish invalid opinion wrong
NONE is it just me or did i see a post of the same name but with intolerance instead of tolerance
AH this argument is so idiotic though i m sorry if i wa rude but come on are you serious if i think feat of modern medicine have been achieved unethically i am obligated to renounce all modern medicine then presumably if you think the tuskegee experiment were wrong you d be obligated not to accept treatment for syphilis and i guess if i think the american indian genocide wa wrong i m obligated to leave america if i disagree with slavery i should do the same since my comfy lifestyle is dependent on the decade of financial growth slavery enabled i mean this argument doe nt hold water in literally any example i can think of the general case is if you have any ethical problem with x you are obligated to renounce everything about x reform is not possible i ca nt help it if paul mccartney or his wife are idiot but i do nt believe you actually think your argument is a good one i apologize if you were actually making that argument in good faith in any case a you can see i ve been happy to engage others here and am willing to have my mind changed although it would probably have to involve someone making a convincing definition of personhood that doe nt include the great ape the other argument i ve seen have not been convincing and i ve replied to each of them edit also the way you wrote your comment wa so blase and dismissive that it really doe nt seem like you re trying to cmv rather you just wanted to give your driveby opinion
NONE well a a moral nihilist in a way i think all life form have equal moral weight that is no moral weight at all i think when being really honest with myself the real reason i make moral decision is just that i wa socially conditioned to and that i have empathy for both reason i tend to make decision that benefit human a lot more there s no scientific reason to have moral of one sort or another and any moral opinion is not refuted by science so you ca nt really be wrong in a lot of way here but i think you probably actually do respond to social conditioning for example if i were to say really racist thing how would you feel it s pretty much the most taboo thing i can think of for americaneuropean culture right now it sound like you ve recognized that there s no real reason to prioritize human and you ve made a conscious effort to revert that opinion but think about what moral are if they are nt absolute read real firmly defined then they re just the preference of a culture and if you can reject which ever one you want then there is no basis for anyone to convince you that your moral priority are wrong the only thing i could say is that you might be happier or fit in better if you demonstrate more generosity to your fellow human but really your priority are up to you
AH man you re a fucked up cunt
NONE my grandma s not a douche man
AH well no not really do you know the principle of learned helplessness chain an elephant to the wall until it know it can not escape replace the chain with a thread and the elephant still think it can not escape subjugating an entire class of people for thousand of year denying them of education and opportunity doe nt magically evaporate because they are allowed to vote especially when they still only have male option to choose from woman today are still product of the generation before them their grandmother probably still think that a woman s place is in the home not to mention the role that is cast on woman every day in movie advertising random encounter it is absolutely ludacris that you think that the right to vote ha made all of these problem disappear and before you dismiss these argument a libtard garbage think about where you get your view from i guarantee that you are just a much a product of your environment a woman are of theirs i would argue that you ve never had an independent thought in your life really think about it
NONE if you take a side in any of those issue then politics is not a waste of time the corruption is there because people are angry the corruption get thrown to the surface so all you hear about are corrupted politician i do nt blame that at all but in the background behind the scene a lot of good thing are being done thanks to politics for example the acceptance of lgbt marriage wa largely due to the community being involved in politics and taking a stand to get the supreme court to legalize gay marriage it happened because we cared antidiscrimination law happened because we care too company ca nt reject your job application just because you re black or asian or female or old or crippled unless it physically prevents you from doing the job of course i think you re taking a lot of today s right for granted most of what we have today would nt be possible without politics and yes it s bigger than one person but altogether it affect you a lot and maybe you can just leave it to everyone else to worry about it but if no one ever worried about it then nothing would get changed for the better
AH christ you are a dumbfuck you do nt have free health care it s paid for by people who work and perhaps do nt want their tax to go towards somebody else s healthcare european tend to be more socialistic on their view american le are you stupid or ignorant your system may work for a culturally monolithic country without this history of private employer paid health care it wa nt the smartest system it s just what we have but to pretend that everyone in the u give a shit about making sure everyone ha health care is plain stupid most people expect others to help carry the load and if they ca nt well too bad
NONE i do nt see it a systematic only a fringe benefit with practical implication that kind of defeat your point if it s not systematic and on purpose it s just a system that doe nt work the world is filled with those willfully allowing death just mean that the government doe nt care the voter do nt really care about veteran so the politician do nt either they do nt get more money or care for the same reason that nasa doe nt get more money not enough people give a fuck having a food fight is easy and fun but cleaning up spaghetti sauce from your keyboard suck people do stuff without thinking of the consequence u government included
AH again give u some case to support your batshit claim you crazy fucking leftist
NONE but you re affected if your government is corrupt silencing everyone trying to fix it
AH what you just said make zero sense to anyone that spends over second thinking about it so i m just not going to pretend any longer that you are nt trolling or disingenuously trying to push an antiblm agenda
NONE i m not talking about legal free speech here necessarily merely when someone is pressed on their viewpoint they fall back on i m allowed to say this instead of backing up their viewpoint you do nt think that they could be agreeing to disagree instead
AH i think omitting political affiliation would force people to actually research these thing and form an opinion of their own rather than follow the current trend this is obviously false it would prevent people from knowing party affiliation by looking at a ballot but would obviously not force them to do further research at all rather than doing further research they would also have the option of either voting with even le information or not voting at all that seems to be central to the premise of your argument and it is transparently not true in the comment you ve described a different viewpoint if we remove this information from ballot fewer people will vote but those vote will be more meaningful i think your argument is disingenuous
NONE there s disparate impact across a number of issue and voter are overwhelmingly ignorant when it come to just about anything we can vote on although usually voter do nt directly vote on issue yes there are referendum but we typically vote for people to represent u in legislature this mean that men could conceivably be voting for woman representative who would cast the direct vote on some abortion law which should be a digression but i guess i ll bring it up to illustrate how much more complex voter choice is the point is that if removal from a circumstance or knowledgeempathy of an issue is the proxy for being able to vote very few people should be allowed to cast a ballot and that s fundamentally undemocratic
AH umizzkittay making up definition to meet her own agenda again
NONE so i succeeded in changing your view or helping to change it
AH fuck you you re comparing my defending my right to fucking exist to a nazi s belief that i deserve to be fucking gassed nazism and white supremacy presupposes that i deserve to die because of how i wa born
NONE haha yeah sure here in the civilized world we would never oppress our minority or pas law in the name of religion you just used a lot of big word to say one of the goofiest thing i have ever read on this subreddit
AH you grew up out of your retarsed communiat liberal phase we re you fine with obongo joke or no i guess they were racist right but making fun of an ethnic surname is not racist and not being a part of the problem
NONE there are plenty of people who object to the term reverse racism completely and i agree with them there is no forward or backwards to distinguish which race is rightside up a far a i m concerned all racism is backwards
AH your wise comment made me rethink my life i wa shocked to see your rchan and rthedonald post history shocked i tell you edit oh and rtheredpill lol
NONE i wa going to answer real nice from my military experience then i reread op s post and the part about the spitting now i have nothing but very violent thought about op well done op
AH now if someone ha extreme tinted window and that cause an accident they should be held fully responsible for the harm they caused to someone else if there is no victim there is no crime huh it s almost like no one ha any reading comprehension for what usnaaky said he s saying none of it should be illegal no matter how dark or even if it the front it s only illegal if they hurt someone dae the nap
NONE i personally wouldt do it because i do nt want my car damaged but that is nt material for the discussion there is a solid chance that if you did this and the person did cause damage to their car you would be liable for said damage if not criminally at least civilly the car wa in a position where it could back up without damage until you put an object there that changed the situation is it worth that risk just to try and teach them a lesson
AH we do that all the time we dont let people carry gun to certain place even though most people would not just shoot people randomly we dont let drunk drive even though some people have done it their whole life without causing a wreck becausr other people ruined that we restrict certain medecines to perscription only because other people have no self control and ruin it for everybody there are countless example and the other point is common sensealtercations are more frequent when people who hate someone are closer in proximity it hard to punch someone foot away so with the line enforced with distance and sometimes a fence you elimiate all potential assault honestly youre coming off so picky and stubborn i would glady slap the shit out of you but the distance between u prevents it
NONE beyond just gaming like what about transgendered youth afraid of coming out sure it may breed homophobia but it also provides support community for those same people who may not be ready to face who they are just yet there s countless community like this that do a great service for confused kid and adult that have more problem than just social anxiety anonymity help you know you re not alone in some case i know it can be hard to ignore sometimes but anonymity on the internet ha changed the way we grow forever it ha provided voice and outlet and community for people safe environment free from your typical judgmental stare and the disapproval of ignorant peer if you ask me that s worth some little shit on destiny telling me he fucked my mom last night i ll ignore of those bastard if it help just person be comfortable in their own skin
AH yeah what the hell is this shit fuck op
NONE yeah this is nothing groundbreaking here

AH lot of childish idiot in this thread i see
NONE i d post this over in rnba instead of here
AH there are many reason why one may go faster than the speed limit whether you agree with them or not a speeding car could be an undercoveroff duty police officer responding to an emergency nope if a cop is going to an emergency then they will be using their emergency light not driving some random car all crazy a father driving his expectant wife to the hospital and speeding a bit from excitement anxiety or minor medical emergency driving to the hospital in this situation render better medical care faster than calling an ambulance and some folk simply can ’ t afford a costly ambulance bill i do nt know what the fuck you re on or if you re just talking out your as to seem smart because you re not an ambulance will get you to a hospital faster and safer and you will get immediate and better care on the way rather than be a dangerous hazard to everyone else it s clear from your comment that you have no fucking idea about what paramedic do a driver with a gastrointestinal issue suck to be you but so what
NONE do you still run red light in those circumstance or wa the hassle of going to court enough to dissuade you it s never come up since in a similar circumstance or perhaps if it did i waited longer and did nt notice it s been year and i think more and rush around le hitting someone with your car is a traumatic experience so i d say that you are putting other people at risk hitting someone when you re at fault might be traumatic but if someone wa jaywalking i do nt think i d lose sleep so i m not standing there like an idiot in the balance of thing doe the standing there being an idiot not make bending a principle a bit more worthwhile also by not jaywalking with the group you are reducing their visibility and increasing the chance they will be hit a driver is more likely to notice a larger group of people also if you intend to jaywalk and try to do so only when safe then if you see an unsafe circumstance say someone down the road going to fast you are more likely to notice and be able to say watch out or the like and warn your fellow jaywalker and avoid damage
AH do nt be confused here i want mgm to be illegal i am just against the use of false analogy stop fighting a strawman asshole
NONE i feel like if they did nt participate then they should nt feel any guilt it s like a white american feeling guilty for slavery
AH i did nt watch his video or read any of the criticism of it but when i saw the vid on my youtube page i scoffed at the idea of doing a six and half minute video about not going to see a film well are nt you an asshole
NONE here watch this it s ten minute long http wwwyoutubecomwatch vrwmxdk unfortunately youtube stuck an advert in front of it but it s the actual channel of the guy who made the video so i want him to get the click for it
AH you are the britta of this sub
NONE all three of you are wrong is evening
AH another one the government gave billion to our biggest internet company so they can improve their infrastructure and they pocketed all the money our hard earned tax dollar
NONE there is also the point to consider that if the japanese government is planning on parting with million there are place to spend it which would save considerably more than two life
AH many of u do nt when they are nt necessary that s the problem it s necessary every time you change position in a car if you think otherwise you re an idiot because sooner or later people like you are more likely to get into an accident learn how to drive or stay the fuck off the road
NONE what do you believe is accomplished by eating food that s unsafe for you it wo nt bring the animal back or make anyone else le hungry one way or another that food is going to become waste and your choice in the matter is whether or not you let it harm you in the process
AH i m sorry year are hard for you but the larger number generally come later in the ad though in bc the larger number is further back the article of confederation were done away with if you d happily recall the constitution need not say it a per the bill of right ammendment and i know you hate this one but still it s there the power not delegated to the united state by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the state are reserved to the state respectively or to the people in accord with it s on word lacking on the matter of secession then the matter is entirely in the hand of the people of those state and binding within the territory of their state the tyrant lincoln hating our form of govt refused to acknowledge reality and sparked the war it s one of the saddest moment in u history it came about due to his desire for war
NONE the people republic of china essentially want the republic of china taiwan to stay part of it because for most of it s history it wa a continuation of a civil war during that war the roc wa beaten back to the island of taiwan where they entrenched themselves up until the roc claimed themselves to be the true ruler of all china now they want a negotiated settlement to keep the area they currently occupy the issue then is that the argument boil down to whether existing a a defacto state for a long period of time entitles you to legitimate statehood especially if it s done at the expense of someone else so while i in general have my sympathy with the roc i can see the prc s point of view too to go for anything other than the onechina policy would be an admission that the civil war wa only a partial success and could be an awkward precedent when dealing with other even more complicated scenario
AH you re just going to downvote that too fuck off hillary slipped and dropped a server in her basement hysterical you have clearly never handled classified material intent ha nothing to do with it unless you re hillary clinton apparently actually in a pretty much any legal case when doe intent matter
NONE that doe nt make any sense if something is legal then it can have no legal penalty you ca nt fine someone for something legal you ca nt jail someone for something legal the only thing i can think of that somewhat fit your argument is to require abortion to be really expensive a a sort of fine
AH ah the ol switcheroo where you go round repeatedly telling someone they are nt using the sub correctly in multiple comment chain and then get all you are nt the cmv police when i suggest winding your neck in yeah you ve really got me there
NONE i agree with this statement there are many case where i need to use one or two bullet when taking note or while writing and it s a bother to stop what i m doing to find the check box and click it it would make life and writing a lot easier
AH you keep respondiong so i feel obliged it s called manner which is why there is no trace of ad hominem in my response your blunt dismissal indicate a certain arrogance on your part and my demonstration were never met with anything that would counter them except for a list of destination i am legitimately bored of this conversation but hope i have the integrity to understand that there exists people that disagree with the premise of the royal family of which i care about only in passing if you feel the need to respond to this i ask that you consider the following article before you do http lightshouseorglightsblogwhyitssmarttolettoxicpeoplehavethelastword axzzdfzqc
NONE by the way how do you feel about the four case i mentioned that wa nt a rhetorical question i really do nt feel like i have a firm enough grasp yet on why you feel this way to understand whether i think i can say what if anything is wrong with it who know you might end up changing my view for example you could accept that people will always compete in their own strength band but you simply think the money donated to fund the specialparalympics would be better spent on famine relief in africa or some other disabilityrelated work or perhaps to training of elite athlete but your original post including the title seems more concerned with the validity or coherence of athletic completion for crapppy athlete in itself
AH you re a yearold on the internet who think they could support themselves so you re probably an idiot
NONE honestly i think thedonald is a cesspool but then again so is rpolitics you are easily banned on there a well

NONE the people who go to icp which to be honest i know nothing about could be trump supporter there is nt this sense of saving that you re trying to argue i mean people could be into icp on a monday and go to a white power meeting on a tuesday they are nt totally exclusive
AH haha of course it would be a fair race just because you lose or are nt a good doe nt mean it wa nt fair seems like you were given too many participation trophy a a kid
NONE i agree but i also think everybody make a bad one bullied or not it s just a byproduct of our pc world all out doe is make kid miss a few extra class a year
AH i do nt know how much more clearly i can say this if his comment are nt about coworkers or potential coworkers then they are useless a evidence for the suggestion he s making the population level statistic explains the ratio of menwomen employee assuming fixed employee quality given that the employee quality is fixed by the hiring process the population level statistic is irrelevant to the employee quality if you fix employee quality at iq exactly you will have different ratio for menwomen depending on the population statistic but all of your employee men and woman will be exactly iq even if the population statistic said that woman have iq point lower than men you are essentially claiming that in such hypothetical case the woman employee would have iq because population level statistic say so if none of his stats apply to google employee then it s nonsense to mention them in reference to google s policy given that seemingly the google policy are based on the premise that the ratio is a result of discrimination this ha the potential go invalidate such policy a unfounded and make change toward policy that make more sense if you approve his manifesto then you should approve of this i m merely using stereotype which are usually accurate and should be encouraged the way jussim mean it which is much more limited than it sound he did nt i value diversity and inclusion am not denying that sexism exists and don ’ t endorse using stereotype it is not difficult to identify what kind of person this is and it s not one who ha any new interesting or useful idea about culture or gender interestingly enough if i used your word against you it would be against the rule of this forum
NONE i do not equate advancing equal right with word choice because in the end having equal right is so much more than what you are called complete equality is difficult to achieve and is indeed much more than word choice but it is also a sum of it part and one of those part is precisely the correct terminology the word we use why and how we use them etc for example consider slur if we were to completely eliminate the usage of various racial gendered homophobic and other slur from our everyday speech to the point that it doe nt even cross anyone s mind to use them would that on it own mean we ve achieved equality no other thing like law right education etc are also needed but on the other hand if we had all those thing i just listed but we were still rampantly using these slur that are based in our difference and that attack people based on which minority they re part of could we say we have complete equality also no i think that social justice activist that feel the need to interrupt intelligent and reasonable debateconversation to insert political correctness do it for self validation rather than to advance the cause this is the title of your post that i d also like to give some attention to you ve given u one example that many would deem extreme within the parameter of your post and the description of the conversation you and your friend were having could you give more example whether from her or others that you would also put into this category of being pc to the point of stunting intelligent conversation i m asking because not all thing are equal in everyone s mind what s irrelevant to you may be relevant to another person and those reason might actually have real relevance to the conversation at hand that you may be dismissing before even taking it into consideration so i d like to get a better grasp on what you see a a valid interruption v an invalid one
AH dude you seem perfict for those sub you d fit right in with your veiled insult and holyer than thou attitude
NONE i do nt agree with any action that result in le nudity to be honest how could any man be pleased with this

NONE there could be people that you have met that are totally sane and do nt tell you that they actually smoke dmt my experience is that the people who always openly and positively talk about the drug they take always seem really dumb i know plenty of people who do heavy hallucinogen but you would never know because they do nt get absorbed into the culture surrounding them and the b that those people talk about
AH this is a girly post you pansy
NONE this is a fantastic explanation
AH if window disappeared neckbeard much
NONE so this is why i unsubscribe weird
AH you having issue with it is not objective what is this even supposed to mean the point come down to you insisting on having sex with people who would object if they knew the truth you know is likely to cause offense you are essentially deceiving people into having sex with you on the premise that they should like it conveniently your morality begin with deserving sex with blatant lie the damage is only caused in this instance if that person happens to be one that take issue with it indeed you are intentionally fucking with people and just sayihng deal with it you are not physically harmed i ca nt believe what i m reaing tbh where are you from u right i can only hope that you are some insecure yearold and not actually a voting living adult in the case of a year old there is damage caused regardless of opinion you might want to look up age of consent the amount of hypocrisy you people have is astounding yearolds canty have sex but you can pretend to be a biological woman to trick men into sleeping with you against their will i think this is contemporary american feminism in a nutshell unadulturated hate entitlement and sexual exploitation
NONE i m going to reverse the gender how would you feel if you were told this is how men should act to avoid falserape accusation http iimgurcomlxtlbjpg you would find it absurd you would say it s absolutely stupid to adapt to a dystopian society instead of trying to improve this society many people have this misconception that rape only happen to attractive and sexy dressed woman in dark alley this is a cliche conveyed by hollywood rape doe nt necessarily come from stranger and it also doe nt only happen to woman who dress up sexy many rapist do it more because of dominationpowerhumiliation reason than because the victim is visually attractive to them this mean that when you start of the path of victim blaming there is simply no limit because there is no point where woman will be safe it start with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe place and it end up with asking woman to stay at home and cover themselves entirely second thing is woman are already taking precaution and they do not need a guide to know what to do what they do nt want is for the medias to present the rape situation a something woman are partly responsible of there are already too many people who still do nt admit that rape is rape in some situation and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true your solution would nt make thing better a i said woman already know what to do it would only make thing worse
AH charisma is a nonintellectual attribute i could have said nicer wiser more artistic or anything else if you re going to take a death by a thousand cut of minutia approach to dissecting my remark then i think i m doing pretty well thus far or you have nt warmed up yet i think the fact that you re being a passive aggressive smart as ha nothing to do with the fact that you re asian if anything if we re going to generalise to racial group and characteristic then i consider you to be letting your side down you re statistically the smartest and this is the best snide remark you can make surely you can do better than that
NONE there might be a benefit think of it this way people like to talk they like to take a subject and even if they only know something tangentially they want to show everyone they know something about it even if it s not relevant imagine you have a person looking through a threat thinking hey i can contribute they then see the itt pointing out that it s not actually contributing i ll bet it probably keep those people from then proceeding to make the same mistake for your example it probably prevents more people from commenting about frying which is beneficial to you a the op
AH you seem to be forgetting that i really do nt care what you think
NONE sure be careful i do nt think you would pas
AH please your mother is the chief case for why city turned into ruin and rubble she is a thief who stole from the american people for the sake of her kind american should nt wear shackle so hyphenated american can steal from the fruit of their labor we get it your mother got lot of gimmiedats for her skin color at the cost of the american people

NONE please read some foreign policy literature from a realist perspective i personally recommend the next year and the next decade by george friedman the basic gist is that it s simply not feasible for u to do what you suggest for the same reason it s not always a good idea to pull the knife out of your body if you ve just been stabbed
AH i havnet said something hateful in a while so ill give it a go i think you re just upset that being trans which you did for attention is becoming too common and thus threatening to make you a commodity forcing you into further and further into depth of degeneracy in order to get your fix of persecution if this wa the s you would have settled with just being gay
NONE late to the party but i agree with you even though that s not the point of this sub i think a trump presidency would be a disaster but it would effectively help to squash a lot of the radical politics that have been cropping up i feel like it s a kind of let them have this one so they ll shut up and realize extreme measure are nt going to work type scenario
AH and now you re just speaking complete and utter garbage with zero proof i m tired of this nationalistic nonsense it s baseless and doe zero good at all i ca nt think of a single positive that would come from your warped world view it s fester hostility aggression and closed dialogue how the fuck do you expect to work with other country when you demand that you are the better and everyone else suck you need to grow up and notice that the world is nt u v them and i m better than you the world is nt your bitch it s not your playground stop it just stop this way of thinking make me scared for the world if you seriously believe this then wwiii is inevitable it s sad at best and jingoism at worst you seem to be just be proving to me of just how dangerous and warped the nationalist viewpoint is and a such is why the anthem should not be played yeah this stupid topic go back to something that meaningless it foster and encourages jingoism is that your end goal because your attitude and view is how you get war
NONE why because of all the thing you know most are verifiably true unless you want to get deeply philosophical eg we know that the sun will rise that the earth is round what your name is and so on further we sometimes use the word know or believe when we are well aware that it s different than the level of certainty that come with something like the shape of the earth you have to go out of your way to start knowing thing that then are nt actually true can you imagine what your life would be like if most of the thing you know are nt true you d put your car in forward and it would it go backwards you d look at your clock and it would say pm but it would actually be pm you d say hi wife and the person would nt be your wife i think you re taking for granted exactly how significant to just basic operation your knowledge is and that this sort of stuff make up the vast majority of your total knowledge and you can trust it otherwise you d be in deep deep profound disarray

NONE i knew a woman who would do this she would also sometimes beat herself up fight club style and then call the cop on people she wa nut probably a sociopath and an addict good thing is that the police got wise to her a did everyone else in her social circle the best defense against rape accusation in this case wa the accuser longstanding pattern of lying and antisocial behavior
AH that s a political term dude what are you smoking because it must be really good shit here this will explain a bit about immigration law which every fucking country in the world ha http enmwikipediaorgwikiimmigrationlaw
NONE it is basically an isought problem but while one should nt expect is a a matter of technological fact here or anywhere else the best you can do is try it s entirely reasonable to be upset when reddit s cultural norm are violated in this particular way
AH if your bar is i am better than a nazi because i let them do what they want then that s a pretty warped way of looking at thing you re the only one here who s setting the bar of my conduct is acceptable because it is marginally better than nazism nazi s greatest ally have always been the moderate majority who believe in the power of democracy and debate but do nt want to have to lift an actual finger to defend minority targeted by them that simply is historically false in fact the nazi greatest ally were the wealthy junker aristocrat who thought that they could use the nazi a a weapon to destroy the liberal and socialist if you do nt see why violence is necessary sometimes you are privileged you have the privilege of not having to worry that a government will actually end your life have some fucking empathy shut the fuck up with this shit
NONE i think technically you are correct but i would say that there is power behind the word nazi it is quite literally the worst thing you can be the people that align themselves with the altright dehumanize everyone that is not like them and call for their eradication from our country it may not be a factual label literally speaking but i think that using nazi to describe these people is descriptively accurate i do nt think we should allow them to hide under more moderate term the word nazi invokes fear and make even the most antipolitical american take notice also it now ha many definition including a person who seek to impose their view on others in a very autocratic or inflexible way i d say that s a pretty good description of these altright activist bottom line is we can not allow this movement to thrive in this country and if calling them a nazi help to wake people up and speak out against them and their attempt to negate the right of others i say go for it
AH i do nt look at user name you just happened to say something else stupid

AH how would you react if there were study that showed working a loom wa effective fletching for that matter it s cute that you are young and stupid but education is nt just done by feels it s done by science
NONE this doe avoid my argument who decides what should be taken seriously and what is there to mandate that something should be taken seriously you drawing line for yourself is fine but drawing line for others is not reasonable
AH please go back to stormfront everyone white guy who doe nt agree with you is a cuck and using pseudo scientific racist garbage disgusting
NONE no i m not going to try to change your view on this your opinion is accurate and anyone who is nt an organ donor is an insane selfish prick
AH it would nt exist if there wa nt a demand for it jackass child are being abused bc people are actively seeking it out how is that so hard to understand sick people who buy those video are just a guilty bc without them there would be no market for it and it would nt exist in the first place how about you just focus on buying exotic animal shit and stop defending pedophile for a little while
NONE i m not talking about child necessarily but mainly about people in the range who might be interest in politics but ca nt vote i have no idea how that would have affected result this is a difference case though there is no need for the entire country to punished because there is only one man responsible and we have the ability to punish him without anyone else getting caught in it

NONE what about to a job interview or when you need to do work like carry log you just chopped the splinter would ruin it
AH i have a big feeling that you re being a douche when you say the majority of these thing and then put your victim complex on display by the way it is inherently antitrans to say that transwomen are nt real woman so yeah you re a dick for that one
NONE what make you think woman are a minority it s very close to a split and i believe it is actually in favor of woman in fact white woman are the most represented sexrace combo out there i totally agree with your last sentence but your first few paragraph do nt make sense at all
AH because we re talking about human life i want you to know that you re a dumbass ban me mod my language is too crude for such an enlightened place of discussion your original post stated a such mandating a set level of healthcare a objectively moral is impossible sure but objective moral are impossible anyways also right are subjective we decide them just like we decide the unit of measurement that we use in our objective science for healthcare to be a right all we have to do is decide that a certain level of healthcare is a right sincerely an electrical engineer p please refrain from attempting to educate others or worse pretending you are logical
NONE it is a difference in philosophy between you and these other people a you ve pointed out there is little way to make a case that smoking pot hurt other people unless you start stretching it into secondary effect like being a slacker or something but there are a group of people who believe that the government ha a moral imperative to protect it citizen and so to them given the evidence that exists regarding the harm you can do to yourself that rise to a valid reason to restrict it now for those of u like myself and you who do not believe that it s the government s place to basically protect you from your own stupidity that doe nt rise to the level of a valid reason but regardless it is a reason
AH that s fine this argument wa never about you it s about people who claim to respect all religion
NONE the one good thing that came of this is i finally learned there is a difference between feminism and sjw s
AH listen dude you are not at all responding to any of what i am saying and this is ridiculous i am just going to keep quoting myself over and over here i do nt need to give a reason why we should nt kill broken and underdeveloped human that is completely outside of the bound of your cmv and is a ethical argument animal do nt have ethic the fact that i need to point this out to you is getting tiresome second thing i never once used the over simple human are special argument way to be condescending to someone who actually mounted a full argument now you are using the word consciousness a your parameter for personhood another goal post shift not covered in yout cmv so if a animal is awake and actively doing something is must be a person this is bullshit
NONE some would say that going interplanetary would be a good idea just in case something detrimental happens to our home planet we have a backup sure people may philosophize on this but if everyone is superhappy on earth who would bother actually doing this overpopulation is another problem that would force u to expand aha that s exactly what i am talking about notice what you said a problem that would force u to expand you seem to agree that it is problems such a overpopulationdriven conflict that would encourage expansion this contradicts your premise that we need to solve all our problem before we can expand if we solve the overpopulationbased conflict here on earth this would act to remove a reason for u to go interstellar
AH go back to rlatestagecapitalism i hope you re happy with your life i really believe that you get what you give and you re responsible for your position in life
NONE thank you for your play by play in the op with your updated position really help and i think it promotes intellectual honesty and demonstrates that you do nt just want to soap box
AH haha you did it againnnn fucking hilarious i happen to have a male body and that s it to a question like how many toe do you have would be an utterly retarded and brutal over simplification this is a really simple and easy concept i suspect you struggle with these routinely
NONE that s actually precisely it they think i did everything i wa supposed to i ve been a nice guy i ve earned sex from her if culture teach men that sex is a reward for hard work then it teach men that sex is their right when they feel they ve done hard work the two are one and the same
AH hey it s pfabs back from the burn unit after day quoting some bullshit without a source that he probably heard from limbaugh or hannity with no basis in reality shocking not really
NONE what if he s tired from work though and decideds to watch netflix for an hour take a shower eat dinner and then send you the pic you are telling me that s not cool it may not be a soon a possible
AH society s favoritism of men haha hahahahahaha hah good joke woman have so many advantage are you fucking kidding me sex woman can get it way easier than men divorce woman are heavily favored in the outcomecustodygetting paid for doing nothing suicide men have it higher homeless men have it higher in the usa men pay for your dinner and your movie ticket what right do men have that woman do nt have oh boy you have to bleed out your genitals how sad for you maybe that s why when the titanic go down you cunt get the privilege of getting off first while we men die on the sinking ship or go off fighting for you
NONE i dislike those because i do nt see how they re relevant in the application process because they can affect your performance are you a married with no kid year old woman odds are you will be needing maternity leave soon thats an unwise company investment unemployed for the last year got ta wonder why other company have turned you down so going back to your yesno tick box how would you prefer op answer he would answer yes the fact that he is the vast minority in not smoking at work he could bring up in an interview you cant tailor form for individual they are there for the mass
AH a a bus marshal maybe he had training to defend himself that others did nt but if so would nt that give him all the more credibility in his action no because no training would advise you to react the way he did specifically because of exactly what happened and yeah have fun losing your arm to an infection after some psycho bite it hahahahaha oh god stop my side
NONE well maybe then his response would be proportionate but he did nt try to restrain her a op said he made move that could be interpreted a a threat back to her and then he knocked her out you ca nt remove a key step and say but surely his act is proportionate now if the key step impact the risk of the situation if i ca nt restrain someone them i would take more serious step but if i just take the serious step that s much le reasonable
AH then you d be both a murderer and a nazi apologist no two way about it thats the way it is an no one care if you felt scared or under duress you cant kill people bro you are responsible for your action this isnt even a debate the fact that you think you d have another option or you d have the ability to hang a jury for this then youre crazy you d be removed from the jury no one would even humor this position in a courtroom like if someone held a gun to my head and told me to kill your mother and i did id like you tell me that you were okay with it that im innocent in your eye
NONE i would say i could not live with killing the stranger i would know that i killed them but if someone killed my loved one it is not my fault it is the fault of those that killed them i think it is very easy to say this when you are sat at a pc presumably skipping work i think having to make the choice between your family and stranger in the moment it would be alot harder to claim the moral high ground reading adolf eichmann s quote in op question i think it sound very reasonable he wa in a bad situation in a bad war doing bad thing it would have been a brave man to refuse the order
AH a a white canadian fuck you slavery wa never legal in canada now in regard to the first nation and how they were treated that is a concern a great one but what about black folk who say immigrate from the uk or africa do they deserve reparation
NONE the use of a nuclear weapon on a population center wa inevitable if it wa nt japan it would have been someone else now we all know in no uncertain term how terrible a weapon they are and to do everything possible to prevent them from being used again
AH ebt and welfare should be completely eliminated jesus fucking christ you re a horrible person
NONE why would he reproduce with a filthy negro do nt you know they re unattractive and therefore inferior
AH this stuff ha been known for year it is nt new maybe you just turned and realized the world is nt a utopia
NONE that s what colonization is though otherwise it s just trade it doe nt have to always work like this but it ha
AH having read your comment i do nt think you understand how healthy relationship work your basically saying you should never have to compromise any part of yourself and that a partner should unquestionably accept all your behavior that is the kind of think i expect form a yo not a adult relationship healthy relationship involve a lot of give and take a lot of compromise the point is that at the end of the day both party end up in a better place then they started it s why people have deal breaker and why they are called deal breaker because the relationship lack the long term potential to make them happy if you are not ready to accept that you will need to experience at least some minor change and accept some restriction you are not ready for a relationship maturity is about understanding your action have consequence and accepting that performing that action carry the risk of that consequence coming to pas i also take issue with how you make one person in the relationship more important then the others i have to accept polygamy but my partner doe not have to accept me because i do nt want to be in that type of relationship it is just a controlling and i would say worse because in my system we part way and can find someone for whom are preferred style of relationship is what they want in your system we are stuck together because breaking up for that reason is wrong who is really trying to stifle others here
NONE i do nt want to require love beforehand because that seems unfortunately incompatible with my generation i think this is the best place to change your view you have had two long term relationship and had your heart broken you ve seen that sex can involve a true bonding emotional experience where you can connect on a very deep level if you have seen that is it so impossible to imagine that others have seen it too human nature doe not change from year to year there have always been people seeking meaningless sex and other people who do nt want that the percentage change a bit but not a dramatically a you might think if you tell a woman that you believe in love before sex perhaps there need not be a specific timeframe i can guarantee from personal experience that more have found it attractive than problematic a far a past partner go is it really the past that bother you or the fear of being cheated on if a woman ha had sex before just like you have but you trust her and your mutual commitment and your mutual love do you really think the past will be a problem for you i suspect that the past is a standin for your future expectation but that with time and trust it will stop coloring your future expectation and therefore will stop being an issue
AH none of this matter yes people survived just fine you have zero reading comprehension for me to say people survived just fine doe not imply that vaccine provided no benefit that is a sincerely idiotic interpretation in fact the connotation of saying that they survived just fine is very much the opposite it mean they dealt with the problem i can only hope that english is not your native language
NONE i agree if this is true if the same job can be done with a lower amount i agreed that is fair i guess i just do nt really see that a being true it is absolutely true the law are stopping some non of people from committing criminal act a we speak like i said initially some do need adjustment but they are clearly effective given that law are carrying out their intended function for the most part
AH go back to pol troll
NONE you lost bro let it go
AH you re a fuckin idiot
NONE you re god damn right
AH you found several dozen way to restate by which i mean reiterate which is to say repeat or in other word retread the same message which overshoot the thoughtful image you re trying to project and land somewhere closer to pontificating windbag which is repellant which wa kind of op s point
NONE well you were talking about doing so publicly which i assume would be in front of a crowd so the previously unknown person would become known i agree with you that if you are in private or in the company of an insignificant number of people it is best to say whatever keep you alive
AH you re intentionally being obtuse at this point

NONE op going through this thing myself i m opposed to hyphensdouble barrel so i think we re are just going with the cooler name
AH i hate to do this but the process is difficult so that people like you ignorant and unwilling to debate or learn ca nt just change thing willy nilly you can of course go fuck yourself i m neither ignorant or unwilling to change
NONE yeah i m actually not going to go along with you moving the goalpost either admit that christian use their belief to justify terrorism just like muslim do and award the necessary delta or stop replying to me i can live with both option
AH lol this is a bit excessive you really do nt like being challenged for clarification i m not sure why d you reply to a cmv if you do nt like being challenged because i wa under the assumption that what the whole sub wa about go give an honest reply to our parent conversation rather than your dank shitposting here
NONE i think this speaks more to how reddit tell everyone to end their relationship with very little context i mean i agree it doe nt sound like a good relationship and i would probably recommend finding someone else too but that doe nt make it abusive you need to know more than yelling happened to make that diagnosis
AH i can and given the fact of what i ve seen i wo nt be far from the truth then what did you say that corporation are amoral but not only in corporation union work also in smaller company and public sector will you call them amoral thanks for showing your true color you feminist cow and you re proving that all woman are indeed evil by nature
NONE but there are feminist that are willing to work with men though true and people like me are willing to work with some of them no one argued otherwise i m simply making the point that there are a plethora of irrational voice both in the feminist movement and outside it that really only want what they want that doe nt make all feminist or all non feminist bad simply people
AH oh fuck off with the meta racist shit fact a majority of people who live in ghetto are black get the fuck over it

AH they do nt want to have a decent conversation with a confederate apologist cuck like yourself stop aligning yourself with the losing side it make you look weak you need to learn to win bigly
NONE do nt change your view live with it republican win because conservative are constantly looking for a reason to be outraged and progressive are constantly looking for a reason to be complacent
AH or you could wear a condom in both case and not cause traumatic suffering to your partner who you trust enough to have to sex but not to tell her you re going to shoot sperm into her body that will cause a spontaneous miscarriage you are a sadistic sort
NONE i do nt understand your question if a woman is pregnant and want to have an abortion she should be allowed because it s her body and she can decide what to do with it period other people do not get to decide whether or not she get a given medical procedure
AH how can you be lesbian if your demiasexual and biromantic because she the hypothetical poster not the actual poster maybe is an insufferable cunt people do nt hate on the long chain of identifier because of some perceived tumblrhate we hate on them because they are annoying narcissistic bullshit if someone asks me if i am gay i say yes i do nt divulge to them my entire sexual history and preference via a list of battered and made up term delineated by hyphen half of the word salad she used is absolutely pointless butchpresenting who care i dont give a fuck how you dress demigreyasexual that is absolute meaningless nonsense completely biromantic nonsense you re either a lesbian or you re bisexual having close bond with men doe nt warrant a special word it s called being human if it doe nt transcend into sexual it s irrelevant the only word there that actually matter are trans maybe and lesbian that s the content the rest is superficial fluff that people add to make themselves special
NONE this however is not true at least of porn consumed by people liking trap includes trap and normal heterosexual men do nt jerk it to trap porn at all so what i d really like to know is what percentage of homosexual men enjoy trap porn because then we can actually make an analysis of whether there s a correlation with sexuality but with what i see we ca nt even do that in my opinion though saying trap porn is gaynotgay is like asking if a triangle is a square or a circle it s easy to conclude that it s more similar to the square but that doe nt automatically make it a square it d still be incorrect to refer to it a trap porn there is nothing wrong with being gay so people who jack it to trap porn should just stop pretending to be straight and go full homo people are weird why should they feel like they have to settle for one camp or another or what about being bi it seems strange to me that if someone like trap porn and say they re straight that person is actually fully homosexual
AH thank you so much for all your pretentious explanation
NONE this is incredible thank you so much for sharing
AH depends on how if you show it so it s ok if you are a fag at home we just do nt want you imposing your faggot way out in public keep it to yourself lipstick lezzies and butch homo are ok we do nt want to see any bull dyke or fag wearing woman s clothes do you think that wa an accurate portrayal of the lgbtq community a a whole yeah actually it is back in the s there used to be objection from certain people in the glbt community who were ashamed of pride but they are silent now when people are granted equality fuck you you did nt fucking grant me equality i took it for myself i we did that sure a fuck wa nt the like of you your kind were told to sit down and shut the fuck up you grant a truth to an idea of how your racecreedsexual preferencewhateverimayhaveforgotten make you who you are yeah they do make me what i am what planet are you from around here the color of your skin determines to a huge degree who your and what you will be it take away your ability to be an equal individual and is nt that the original goal what minority lack is political equality the way one achieves that is by standing up identifying yourself and then taking your right back from the privileged
NONE one vote is nt enough to change mind but it doe make you visible for the first time citizenship is an essential first step to many of your goal and i still do nt understand what not getting citizenship get you dithering and delaying mean accepting the status quo the only change that happens is the change that is made to happen waiting simply mean that change is delayed how many people suffer because our immigration system is broken a hell how many people would be upset to hear that you are choosing not to speak up for them a voice count more than a vote but having the citizenship make your voice louder and more commanding a well a giving you a vote you have a chance that many people never will and i simply do not understand why you do nt want to take it is it self consciousness do you doubt that you can do it well that s not a very american way of going about this we accomplish great thing all the time and the only thing that can stop you is you change is there for the taking so take that first step and do something remarkable how doe that saying go shoot for the moon even if you miss you ll be among the star that is doubly true for political policy which is arbitrary in any event
AH i do nt think i ve had any nonsexual encounter that wa affected by gender maybe you re inventing problem for yourself to explain underachieving may a well see why people think gender is such a big issue but no a perfectly reasonable statement is removed in a discussion forum america where gun are fine but feeling are fucking lethal grow the fuck up
NONE i agree a would most people in fact most people who fail to control emotion are considered to have a disorder anxiety issue anger management issue ect lack of emotion is also a problem someone correct me if i m wrong but i believe that s a hallmark of autism it okay to have emotion and express it but action should nt be decided until you ve had a cool off period at least
AH thank you for teaching me something new today you pretentious prick not everybody on the internet is an illiterate year old who s never read more than the first few chapter of harry potter

AH they did seize grain from peasant and export it in order to industrialize the country but the idea that they were stealing from starving peasant at the height of the famine is a myth again le than wa being exported certainly the harvest decline wa not the only cause of the soviet famine the regime exported food during the crisis the amount of grain exported during the peak of the famine in the first half of however approximately ton wa small le than percent of the lowest harvest estimate and the regime wa using virtually all the rest of the available harvest to feed people mark taugers natural disaster and human action of the soviet famine of the data on how many people were killed in the purge wa archival and wa never meant to be viewed publicly that s why it wa only after the soviet union collapsed that we were able to see the data not to be a douche but you re kind of talking out of your as but i get it a american if you are we re told from birth that communism is evil
NONE it s already been pointed out that the idea of wwii being directly linked with social change in the u is nonsense and even if it wa nt nonsense the same could not be said of everywhere else in the world to the point where it would still seem pretty dubious to call it a net positive keep in mind that wwii is also what allowed the ussr to coalesce under stalin which resulted in the murder of more than million people and the imprisonment of untold others there were enough targeted killing of jew during that period to render your point about genocide moot meanwhile over the u the outcome of wwii for usussr relation empowered mccarthy to form the huac to combat communism domestically not to mention the cold war and the resultant covert u intervention in foreign conflict aimed at containing the ussr and communism that are responsible for much of the clusterfuck the world s in today also the chinese civil war
AH i m really surprised to find that someone so active in a community that educates others through discussion is telling me that there s no value in it how did you even get those delta did you just tell people that there s no value in challenging their opinion wa that what changed their mind
NONE yes a university can create connection and get you job but i agree with you that it is the person who get the education that matter i understand that some school are better than others but i also think that in the end it doe nt always matter where you went to school
AH cite tumblr think the argument exception to the rule mean that the rule never existed is a logical argument expects to be taken seriously
NONE is it really unreasonable to believe the freedom regulation of speech shouldnt should be used to propagate deminish genocide ftfy

NONE i recently forgot to finish a major assignment that wa due for one of my class it wa a huge part of my grade and extremely important but i forgot to finish one last bit and turn it in it had nothing to do with how much i cared about it i just forgot some people just do this perpetually it s not a reflection of the importance of something it s just that holding on to information in the short term is a skill not everyone is great at my solution ha been to keep a very careful calendar with lots of reminder so i do nt forget to do thing anymore
AH you thought the first one wa of value too your standard is laughable i m not dedicating hour on end to researching at your insistence before you pissed away your credibility i would have been you ve done nothing to try and repair it except insult me so no i ve got other shit to do this is at least an entertaining distraction and one i can trust to keep me laughing
NONE agree with op i have a family and theyre really all i care about i would never ever go out of my way to hurt another person or lie or cheat them in order to benefit myself and my family but i do nt see why i should have any obligation to go out of my way to help others why should i have to speak out against some aggressor and put myself and therefore my family at risk it s not my responsibility
AH doe this happen often it sound like you re reaching pretty damn far for a valid reason to hate smoking if you re asthma is triggered that easily it s probably triggered by car exhaust but are you going to take a stand against car not really apple to apple effect of lingering cigarette smoke on clothing http wwwlivestrongcomarticlecancigarettesmokeonclothingcauseallergysymptoms what if the person had terrible gas after eating that much shit and their powerful flatus triggered asthma or something similar see how silly that sound hyperbolic example to counter my realworld example find an article linking something like asthma or another real affliction to flatulence outside of minimal discomfort a far a health care cost healthy people in this case people of normal weight can put just a much strain on the heath care system by way of extreme sport injury people choose to participate in extreme sport can and do suffer terrible injury with long hospital stay and do nt forget a bout pt but no one talk about that fat health issue may be far more frequent and costly i really do nt know but if we re going to discus unnecessary strain on the health care system we should talk about all unnecessary strain only a troll would go so far a to suggest that healthyfit people and their extreme sport injury have any where near a significant an impact on the overall healthcare system a people being overweight it s not an all or nothing type of argument we can not ever eliminate all unnecessary strain on the healthcare system people are going to smoke drink have unprotected sex eat more than should and exercise le than they should let s try to fix the problem that are the largest and make them smaller get back under your bridge and go eat some goat
NONE i would argue that if anything the opposite is true i mean maybe if you re the rock and you re eating calorie a day or whatever that s having a big effect but for most active people you re not actually adding a ton in term of caloric need to your life so you should nt be eating a ton of extra food is it still more than a sedentary person yes but a sedentary person will drain the earth s resource in other way the older you get the more likely a sedentary lifestyle is to cause all kind of health problem and of course one of the main one is obesity in which case you ll be eating that extra food anyway if it were likely that one could remain sedentary while not affecting their health then i would agree your view is technically correct although the environmental effect of one person eating a few hundred extra calorie a day is minimal and could be mostly offset by you keeping a few chicken yourself or something but the health issue associated with a sedentary lifestyle even if you eat right can also be a huge drain on resource think of it this way you re eating a little extra food but you ll be taking fewer ambulance trip to the hospital fewer plane flight to see specialist requiring fewer medication etc etc i do think there s a limit to this i think it could be argued that bodybuilder for example are nt really doing much to promote their own longterm health and they eat a shitton a well a take all kind of steroid and supplement that use up resource but if you re just going to the gym and lifting a few time a week i would nt sweat it and if you re driving to the gym you could offset the extra food you re eating by biking instead or getting some free weight and setting up a little home gym so that you re not burning fossil fuel to exercise
AH your basic premise is if i do nt know you personally i do nt need to respect you this is basic caveman psychology
NONE cmv my university should include a place i can go where i do nt need to hear any opinion that do nt directly support my own
AH i do nt know what the hell your problem is this debate ha never been about legal validity but rather about what is moral and what is not you re basically trolling at this point intentionally or not
NONE no it is nt i m made the claim that something doe nt existshappens which is by default correct if there is nt any evidence that something existshappens you generally should believe that it doe nt
AH maybe something relevant the lbj quote is relevant because of this it is exactly the same a what you are claiming the repubs are doing right now the only difference is which crowd each politician wa looking to grab up and if you refuse to see that then i do nt need to hear anything else you have to say but please sit on your high horse with your finger in your ear like a year old that will surely get the conversation to a productive space quickly
NONE it sound like you re agreeing with me actually you do nt get there just because you are qualified that is exactly what i am saying the chance exists but more than likely your skill alone are not getting you to the top however knowing an editor at forbes and having the skill absolutely can get you to the top because you re not the only one with a level of skill that would be desirable for them but you might be the only one who can actually get a chance to show them your skill and you get that chance from knowing someone at the top
AH the republican have nt appealed to anyone the dems have driven them out with identity politics the republican see a lot ha changed at this point it look like they have seen more change than you have if i am taking you seriously they are planning on this change and this change brought trump into the white house you must be truly stupid or truly egotistical to seriously think the republican are a static force a much fun a it is to call them name a such the dems have won the popular vote but the popular vote doe nt matter at all whatsoever and that s how it wa intended i d make reference to athens and socrates but judging by your thought process you clearly are nt that educated or you could be but are so utterly self centered a to think that you genuinely are right and everyone else is wrong either way a lost cause and yes those white people that share democratic value they voted trump this past election that s why trump won the logical step then would be to examine why this happened and take step to make the change to ensure it doe nt happen again that is exactly what you are arguing against like are you stupid or just really really full of yourself
NONE i feel like you re arguing against something that is nt really happening like you said yourself both in your original post and in the comment there are some aspect of character that can be changed and depending on the character it can be color religion gender etc i think we all agree that there are some change that are good to make and others that would be bad i think that the people making the change realize that it s not like they just throw every established character into a hat and pull out a random race religion and gender for them i feel like the point you re trying to make is that we should think before we change classic character and i m pretty sure that the people in charge of them do that sure everyone can get thing wrong and there can be debate over whether or not a specific change is a good move or a bad move but there s no right answer in most of those case nobody is trying to change james bond into jimmy bond the cia agent from boston and even if they were would nt you have to watch the movie first before you could tell if the decision paid off
AH you re the one with the flawed definition of democracy this is one of the dumbest post i ve ever seen on reddit a constitutional monarchy is not a fucking democracy what the fuck is wrong with you

NONE people are stupid when it come to percentage but you know what lot of people are also stupid about rate and proportion i do nt want to have to change the rule because people really ca nt handle basic math i ve taught th grader how to do basic interest if a person walk into a bank or buy something with interest without knowing what they signed that s on them and not the world
AH are you a fucking retard what actually make you think a doctor can disregard a will and do whatever he want guess what champ you re wrong people a stupid a you should be people banned from getting organ donation so they ca nt reproduce and spread their stupidity
NONE unhinged liberal do not care about your logic he hurt their feeling and make them feel weewee bad that is enough to impeach him never mind that he ha yet to do anything remotely impeachable you are dealing with mentally broken people that can not concede defeat

AH the way you worded this doe not seem to suggest you are here in good faith serious response atheism is simply the rejection of the existence of any god are you religious do you believe in vishnu why or why not on the off chance you are hindu do you believe in allah why or why not science ha nt told u everything but it and academic philosophy in general including cognitive science anthropology literary criticism etc ha told u enough that anyone with a brain can look at any religion and find part that are obviously false for example according to the bible pi is exactly equal to hah sound like the kind of shoddy math a bronzeage nomadic tribe would use or if you are pickier the inconsistency within genesis about how the world began or the absolute capriciousness and irrational anger of the old testament god or the inconsitent and vague passage in the new testament the bible is obviously a collection of mythology it s no more proof of god than the illiad is proof of achilles and the same go for every other religious text so an athiest is someone who see all these false religion see that there are no religion which are consistent with reality and extrapolates that there is no god in the first place and every religion is made up which is rejecting only one additional religion out of all the thousand there have ever been than the most devout follower
NONE yes in the strictest sense you are right to be christian you must believe what you just said at least in the protestant catholic tradition but here s the rub that ha nothing to do with the sacred text themselves regardless of what ha been hammered into several generation what i m saying is christianity is not about the text or word of god it s about a specific view of how you should interpret the text if you question that view whatever one you grew up in then the you are not christian the same go for islam and judaism the irony though is the sacred text themselves when you read them without the baggage of childhood indoctrination they do have a central theme that is constantly overturning religious leader leader who want to tell the people how they should view god the bible is about human nature the human spirit and our relationship to something greater than u yet is u and impact our daily life in the present i think people pick and choose because they re trying to reconcile a belief a belief in how they are supposed to view the text the cross for our sin the shedding of the blood the faith through grace the trinity the supra lapsarian and on and on oh lord when in fact the actual text ha nothing to do with any of those thing it s richer deeper and it s immediate but we re raised into a view of what it mean not raised to discover what it mean you would never want to disregard sacred text or mistake a dominant interpretation for the real truth of what is in it
AH i d love to internet slap the shit out of you right now so social issue that affect men are rightly given le concern than issue than affect woman because these issue affect more woman more intensely than issue that affect men are you fucking kidding me do you know how pissed off i get when i have to go to the hospital and there is always a woman s health center where is the men s health center guess what there is nt one at of the hospital i ve never seen one that s just one example men get shit on all the time we are expected to be some bastion of perfection always taking care of money the house fixing thing and whatever if we show any sign of weakness or even feel like cry we are somehow le take your sjw shit somewhere else men deserve equal right and the dirty little truth is no one want to admit it because you throw out stats like how many woman are in congress or how many woman ceo there are well i ll tell you what it s a different generation and if you d put your big girl pant on maybe you could be a congress woman too maybe you could head general motor yahoo pepsi hewlettpackard mondelēz international ibm xerox lockheed martin or more btw this is just a short list of major company led by woman i m sick and fucking tired of this victim mentality so many woman perpetuate and do nt even get me started on the wage gap argument http wwwwashingtonexaminercomharvardproftakesdowngenderwagegapmytharticle because it is bullshit men have feeling too and you know what fuck all the woman who stomp all over them because of their perceived notion that they are somehow shit on i do nt know what your situation is but if you want equality and you think your life is nt going the way it should do something to change it do nt blame men for your problem because time have changed
NONE i assume you re asking to have your view changed that you should be happy well you should nt be happy there are at least thing terribly wrong with this view a a liberal i doubt you think aid is a joke yet almost the exact same phenomenon is happening in africa we send aid worker there they inform people they still get aid sometimes they attack aid worker we re trying to help them and they do nt for whatever reason take our help same thing happens with birth control all over the world do you really think the right thing to do is just laugh because you believe you re superior that we should nt consider the complexity of the situation or the affected people belief of course you do nt but like a lot of liberal you wo nt take those mental step when it affect other white american i think this is the kicker take all the other american that think like you do now go back in time and raise them where all these conservative live those liberal will on average grow up to be the conservative this is a very well established phenomenon ie conservative are the same kind of human a liberal just to drive this point home with something i think you may be more willing to believe you do nt believe black are inherently criminal right you think they are more criminal cause they undeniably are on average because they grow up in rough situation and go to bad school etc etc grow up in a good area with good school and they thrive like any other human same thing with the opposing view on average you do nt believe what you believe because you re some special person who ha it all figured out you believe it because of your influence on average so if you are actually the one with truth why would you ridicule those without it they do nt choose to not have it they just have nt had the opportunity
AH but without the government we re all in the state of nature the government is a state of nature government is no different than nature human artifice is nature how do you differentiate what is nature from what is not so nazi germany wa just sweet it wa until it passed the moral event horizon which caused it failure

AH ok i ll play your silly little game that a black sounding name indicates ghetto culture which indicates that the holder of the name is part of a monolithic group who all share the same value fault and world view sound pretty racist to me the idea that ghetto culture is significant in negative value that are nt shared in equal measure in mainstream culture or to put a finer point on it those negative value are only really seen a extraordinarily negative if seen in the context of black culture again pretty darn racist better the point is that poverty and cultural value are the deciding factor another dog whistle argument eh tell me why is it so important to you that it not in anyway be about race even though that s obviously a factor tell me how poverty and cultural value explains driving while black tell me how poverty and cultural value explain that black child are punished more harshly and more often for minor offense that white are nt and how that same pattern can be seen in the criminal justice system for adult
NONE gender dysphoria is still a mental disorder that can be identified if there s no physiological correlate how can you be so certain the same thing ca nt be true of racial dysphoria if the gendered part of the brain can be data why ca nt the racial part of the brain be data i would argue that racial dysphoria ha exactly the same ontological status a gender dysphoria dysphoria is a feeling if you can feel like you re the wrong gender i see no reason you ca nt feel like you re the wrong race particularly if a you suggest it s only data stored in the brain i would further argue that cultural appropriation is a feeling a well not an objective behavior or event every culture in the world in the history of the world is syncretic they re all assembled of the piece and bit of the culture they followed or coexisted with culture is a collection of ideas and nobody owns them unless you ve patented kilt or something weird like that so when someone adopts something that another culture doe people of that culture may feel offended and very proprietary but it s not possible to own an idea

AH like i said i do nt ever call people dumb online except this it take about two second of self contimplation and exploration to realize that you are not only wrong in relation to all other historical frame and country but all other market a well furniture is so cheap and so easy to come by that it one of the most obvious example of the success of capitalism the failure is in people that are too snobby for used or too lazy to spend hour at minimum wage looking for it or too inept to spend an hour fixing it so they go to ikea and complain about that amazing technological achievement too it living in a beautiful plentiful world and taking a shit on it because you are restricting your own option to the one that everyone else is doing i picked a random city cleveland here s the free section of their craigslist http clevelandcraigslistorgsearchzip in two week your house is furnished for free i see a couch bed desk garage door wood carpet glass it such a beautiful communist utopia in the free section of craigslist and self professed communist do nt even fucking care they re too busy shitting on everything not calling you that bad but it amazing that this goldmine of free stuff for the poor get ignored completely because it doe nt come from the government or someone in a suit patting themselves on the back and all you need to do to trade up on this stuff is resell it to other lazy people like yourself just a week ago my renter who are older and have nicer stuff than me from ikea were too lazy to fix up a couch and work a week reselling it they priced it at i gave them restuffed the cushion and resold it for to a bunch of lazy college kid
NONE if you were the person who made this a reality i would make absolutely sure that whenever you were having an intimate moment with a special lady you d get the image of me furiously jacking it and making lewd comment about the woman you re with my point being there are some thing we do that are private for reason other than we are lying to people and that s fine i have a right to privacy you have a right to privacy and if that mean that sometimes people lie that s a sacrifice i m willing to make so that my life doe nt become a livestream that gain hundred of viewer whenever i get intimate with my lover or for that matter my hand besides that point none of my friend need to know every time i do either of those thing edit reading the rest of the post i see that you have no value of privacy but i and many other people do so here is how strongly a bunch of people feel about it first i or someone like me find a way to hack that system and replace my stream with either past stream of my day and i can even get a month s worth of daily footage just by having a very samey routine for a month or the stream of someone else who s going to notice i can still wear the glass and have a piece of spyware on the piece of software that detects who s trying to view the stream and if it is someone close to me who could see that what i should see is nt what is being shown to everyone else they get the real stream so now i m free of the invasion of privacy free to find other people with similar view free to infect their system with a similar hack and organize a resistance whose goal is purely to end the people responsible for this breach of privacy that make prism look like someone peeping in my window
AH dude if you re going to reply to someone in this subreddit either provide a substantive answer that back up your contribution or do nt comment at all saying that s wrong is nt conducive to discussion why are nt the others legitimate reason what is your support your evidence why waste your my and everyone else s time by just saying that s wrong how much more of a selfrighteous douche could you be participate in good faith or go away
NONE so when you say anonymous what exactly do you mean that they ca nt see their face seems kind of important for being able to identify someone especially when eyewitness testimony and photographic evidence is so important not knowing their name again seems pretty important in any case where there s documentary evidence how would you know if the person listed on the contract is the defendent unless you said their name your notion of anonymity is escaping me a little bit what doe anonymous mean to you
AH maybe you should invest in some better security usually people who live in poor neighborhood and get home invaded are too poor to afford extensive security they own firearm for the one time purchase for protection interesting how naive you are to these simple detail because you are concerned over the intruder life you break into a person s house and threaten their life you do nt get much sympathy from me inb you call me psychotic or some other dumb shit
NONE here s the thing it s unfair now but do you really expect you will get through life without getting sick you help those two sick people today them year down the line a couple healthy people will help you when you are sick you could similarly say that two people are getting assaulted but do not have enough money to fund a police force but you do you say that you do nt want to pay for their protection but down the line it might be you who need the police
AH you will never convince these people they are doing something wrong they are so brainwashed by their bash the fash ideal they ca nt see anything else these people would kill baby if you told them the baby might grow up to be facists they do nt have a shred of introspection and are too stupid or unwilling to see the slippery slope they are on you are correct it will get out of hand it s imperative you and sane people like you are ready to act when they switch from antifascist to antianyone not like u it will happen sooner then you think
NONE people are going to say all sort of crazy shit to make themselves look good you ca nt stop that you only need to judge them by their action not their word telling men they ca nt be feminist is just going to offend them and make them le supportive to the feminist cause very similar to how the black life matter movement ha caused so many backlash due to them segregating themselves not sure if my thought are capable of swaying your opinion but i would just like you to know there are men out ther who legitimately want to see woman a equal in all thing

NONE summer in alaska are considerably warmer http wwwalaskaorgexpertadviceweatherclimate than that i would suggest that what you really are saying is i hate the idea of living in alaska which i would nt even attempt to change and everyone else should too which seems wrong on the face of it would you acknowledge that generally people have different preference that in fact some people like thing that others hate if so then you should be able to see why someone might choose alaska even though you would never do so
AH i hate to do this but the process is difficult so that people like you ignorant and unwilling to debate or learn ca nt just change thing willy nilly the founding father did not like democracy and saw it a mob rule in fact only property owner were originally allowed to vote and senator were elected by the state government all of those thing you have mentioned are very controversial and if can change something so powerful you will have a very very pissed off so much so that we would have lot of instability and rebellion through out this country history stability come from lack of change and you cement that with written rule that are hard to change remember the federal government is nt even supposed to have a much power a it doe now but democracy ha changed that for the worse
NONE the will of the people is always free to be persuaded and it often is there is nothing wrong with republican safeguard like limit and appointee they add stability to the democratic principle judge should nt be politician for example i d say you are quite wrong about how those social movement were successful they relied completely on political support the people who enacted them were chosen to do so simply because they had to use force to ensure the freedom were protected doe not mean it wa counterdemocratic there is always a backlash with reform but i would nt consider any of them majoritarian strong democracy have the requirement to bend to public will which allows for maximum flexibility and stability other system ignore public will and can turn on a dime if they so wish
AH then you do nt get an opinion sorry but that s some bullshit while i do nt agree with op that doe nt mean you have to be personally affected by what ever you are having an opinion on that s like arguing religion and saying sorry only people of my religion is allowed to speak against it now sure referring him to doctor and scientist is a good thing but he is arguing for there not being transgender people so you ca nt tell him he ca nt talk about it because he is nt one fuck you everyone get an opinion even the uninformed
NONE i d argue it s not proven that trump dislike mexican so that part of your argument should be changed trump not wanting mexican to come in illegally doe not necessarily mean he doe nt like them he might or might not but this fact alone doe nt prove it you d need more evidence and i have nt seen any that would convince me either way it s also not proven he dislike muslim wanting to keep them out doe nt mean you do nt like them being concerned that they might cause violence doe nt necessarily mean you do nt like them either basically you can like a person yet still want them to be kept away because it may cause a problem with people closer to you
AH and your read wa wrong agree to disagree so in summary you re basically a lonely and sarcastic child unable to deal with opposing position on civilly or intelligibly sure if that s the story that make yo feel good we ll go with that i had intention on shifting this interaction back to some level of rational discourse nah you never wanted that but you clearly lack the cognitive faculty necessary for such discourse yes clearly let me know when you ve developed the maturity necessary to deal with argument without having your fits screed no go fuck yourself never speak to me again you ll get the last word if you respond once more we both knew that this would be the case since this will probably be my last post thank fucking christ there is no point in attempting to reason with unstable child agreed and in the future you should always assume that i am an unstable child stay far away
NONE i would honestly say that what you are seeing is a symbol be it comma or a dot plus if the next word is capitalized or not those two thing are enough to get all the info you need do you know what just happened when i read your first two word i would i actually looked at my previous comment to check whether i had asked a question because i did nt remember doing so that s confusion that would nt exist if you had simply used a comma those two thing are enough to get all the info you need a i said before it s not about just getting the information the efficiency is important too you may think that reducing the number of part of a language would lead to greater efficiency but you d be wrong everything need a bare minimum number of part to make it work by taking away the comma you re trying to remove one of the more essential part of punctuation if you advocated removing the semicolon i could get behind you
AH i am proposing a hypothetical form of government of course this form of government would not work today a the u government is highly corrupted something would have to change none of those people went to jail because of corruption nobody can arrest a union member if the government doe nt allow it yes in our society that is not libertarian it is allowed but in a libertarian one it would nt at least not in the one i m proposing oh you re a philosopher you ve studied metaphysics and can say that with complete certainty ok once again those people in chile were not doing anything near what i am proposing this entire argument is retarded it s never going to end there is an infinite regress i think i m done i need to study for my chem test

AH you operate under the hilariously naive assumption that the right need a reason to attack the left you should be defending antifa against fox news nazi apologism not throwing antifa under the bus for having the audacity to stand up to nazi it should be noted that the practical use of this sort of violence is le than zero violence is the only thing that ha ever stopped sufficiently motivated fascist
NONE umastergrok hit the nail on the head though there is not a perfect overlap between the morally and ethically correct thing and the institutionally expected thing even if the error is le than you need a term to describe that error rate and yes of course it will be used a a defense in wrong case but should we get rid of the right of self defense because it is often claimed improperly by the accused

AH i have nt said it doe nt happen please provide a source confirming the number of illegal vote cast in the previous election i d say getting legal voter to the poll is far far more important than preventing an insignificant amount of possible fraud and that is nt done by making it more difficult to vote that is a red herring which would bother you more slightly more difficult to vote but you still have the option or your vote is canceled by fraudulent voting we know the answer it absolutely matter you sound like a treasonous traitor to me
NONE vote third party if the two big party do nt offer what you want support the alternative you do want or if you think they do nt have a fair chance support voting reform at the very least vote for the candidate that best fit your view chance to win or not doe nt matter it s all about the signal and the signal that you give when you do nt vote is that you re too apathetic to manage even the least possible effort to be politically active and can safely be ignored by the power that be remember not voting is not protesting it s surrendering
AH this is absurd op s criticizing them for promoting a political agenda any political agenda whichever agenda they re pushing op disagrees with them doing that personally i think political agenda serve a purpose on the show and that this particular show is specifically made to promote certain belief but you can not reasonably criticize op who even made an edit insisting he doe nt care about what belief the show is presenting for something he is nt saying at all you re a spaz

NONE i d see it more a a matter of jumping on an opportunity when it arose the people of these country wanted independence but comparing the two situation north and south america the spanish empire needed those colony far more britain wa not happy to lose it american colony but in the grand scheme of thing they were not a top priority meanwhile spain wa completely dependent on south and central america for just about all of it resource only with spain facing ruin at home could they stand a chance at breaking away however i think that s a red herring my suspicion is that the usa held together because it wa based on foundation in english common law rather than napoleonic civil law

AH alright then do nt my intention wa nt to be bitchy or condescending i could if i wanted to though but you skip between gender and sex so often that i ca nt make out exactly what you re trying to say a lot of the time that combined with the shallowness of most of your claim lead me to believe that you do nt have a sound enough argument in mind edit and nice of you to cherrypick one line that you do nt like and ignore the rest of my interesting point because you were somehow offended by whatever tone you assumed i wa taking on real nice way to avoid discussion prop to you
NONE yeah i think it would be possible to make an argument against your view there but it would take more nuance than i wanted to muster the time for right now that s not what i wa trying to argue against i wa trying to argue against your assertion that white male cisgendered comedian ca nt really ever be said to be punching up but then i read back and realized that you restricted that comment to joke about race and gender so i wa trying to argue against something that wa nt there sorry about that i may try to come back with more nuance and argue about the punching down side of thing but not right now

AH i do nt get your implied sense of entitlement here your cmv make it out to be some kind of grave injustice if white people ca nt also use the term then you completely missed my point there is zero entitlement here and by using that term you are showing me you completely misunderstood my point the point i m making is if you use the term niggernigga do nt be offended when those you have influenced use it too if the term offends you then do nt use it and perpetuate it s use in society if you use a term that a minority ha reclaimed for themselves you essentially take away some of their sense of empowerment that they get from it it s a denial of it historical meaning a a tool against oppression no it not you re so wrong it s literally showing how the table have turned in society before white people used the term to degenerate black people after they use it to be like black people those aspire to be like black people following and emulating them you re either too stupif to see that or you do nt want to see it
NONE could be a matter of perspective or interpretation but i do nt think hate is the right word or maybe you re using it a little too liberally if you want it to change for the better then you see the potential for it and are frustrated by the current state but to say you hate it is in line with the most nihilistic sentiment and at least to me would mean you would nt care to see it burn down or blossom and depending on your conviction would want to contribute to it demise i d think genuine hatred would be absolute a in you d hate the past present and future without any consideration for it to be redeemed but you re just saying i wish it wa better which is more along the line of a parent being disappointed with their child because they are nt living up to their potential or are making bad decision it might be that you resent the current state of the world through disappointment but i would nt be so quick to lump yourself into the same category a mass murderer and people who go out of their way to do harm

NONE i think it speaks to both of miley s and the youth s quality both for spreading what i consider to be a bad message and the youth for accepting it a hedonistic view is nt so bad but i think it the worse of the two view i think it would be better if more people thought like me about sex but i would also want those people to come to that conclusion in the same philosophical spirit that i have i would nt want to force them to believe sex is more meaningful either

AH people like you are what s wrong with the world cognitive dissonance all over the place here i ve guessing you ve never been raped and then forced to have a child a fetus is nt a human you ve already lost that scientific debate countless time so we do nt see it like that because it s wrong i d like to see what would happen if someone shoved a parasite into you and then said well it deserves a chance to live so you can give it away in month even if you agree to do it you ca nt force others to do it because it is nt your fucking body
NONE but if it wa i honestly dont believe it would bother me when you re in a perfectly temperate room you do nt notice the temperature but when you re too hot or too cold you do i suspect gender is the same when everything is in alignment you do nt even notice when there s a discrepancy though you do and it s bad enough that people often commit suicide over it so i suspect it probably would bother you i do nt think you have the necessary life experience to judge how strongly it would affect you having never experienced it
AH dude what the fuck is kek obama wiretapping confirmed your mulatto messiah is gon na die in prison

NONE do nt know if this will be helpful to you or not but the best research we have to date would suggest that fish do not in fact feel pain here s a link backing this up http wwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtm it sound like you ve pretty well thought out the other factor so i guess you ll have to decide on how persuasive you think the science is with regard to whether or not animal feel pain
AH can i just say i have real respect for you not many people would continue to mindlessly argue against point that were never made to begin with even when what wa really being discussed had been proven by the other party
NONE today i resisted using the down vote to disagree with someone and instead engaged them in a discussion where i think we both came to understand the other person view a little better even if we did not change our mind
AH lolz so you are a white knight bravely marching out to the battlefield to keep woman weak and stupid good job you are the problem you think that woman are so fucking inferior that we need to protect them because they will swoon and faint when given other opinion this just make my point i did say several time it is some feministssjws that are weak and prone to hysteria not woman
NONE they only want to educate child a much a they need them educated to make good but unquestioning wage slave so they do want to educate them to a point but that is mixed in with a lot of subtle and not so subtle obedience training ie move around when the bell ring obey without questioning think about what i say it s fuckin gross really and the kid come out stupid because everyone hate it

AH a a soldier war is my profession a a civilian peace is yours if you fail yours i wo nt fail mine above all people it is the soldier or any service member who prays for peace the most because he is the one who ha to bear the scar of war most people who enter the service are nt blood thirsty they just see how fucked up the world is and want to do something about it or they just want a better life for themselves or their family so war is our job but it is nt our desire so fuck your hippie bullshit
NONE i agree and i m in the service risking your life for others by no mean equal doing any good i ve met enough serviceman that did nt join to do any good or are nt even interested in doing any also it s just a job people who join from a desire to serve a nation are woefully delusional doing something heroic make you a hero and nothing else besides the fact that a willingness to kill to preserve or expand your nation interest is questionable ethic at best you still did nt do anything
AH a baby is a living being obviously you are ignorant a to the biological definition of life there is also a big difference between taking care of something and having it in your body there have been plenty of stupid comment in this thread a expected but yours is the most retarded congratulation you win the dullard award
NONE in central illinois there are some single locked restroom in public place that say either gender it make sense to me it s not like seeing a urinal is going to scar a woman for life and men wo nt die if there are pad and tampon in the garbage if all have a changing table that also make it le of an issue for whichever gender is taking care of a baby

NONE i agree most people are offering overly simplistic solution to a problem that is nt remotely simple do nt have any good answer myself but i think an open and honest admission from everyone that we do nt gave a fuckin clue and maybe we need to have some very humble discussion about this i m not optimistic though
AH you are not just far right which is bad enough you are outright nazi the problem throughout europe are caused moslty by deregulation of the financial sector and overall neoliberal economics which are the opposite of left politics there are no left party in power in europe and there have nt been any in a long long time the closest it come to left are the centralist scandinavian one
NONE i would argue we could achieve many of the same benefit while steering clear of the potential issue of voter suppression by legislating against outright lie in political campaigning like we have no elected representation in the eu for example how successful that would be is uncertain and i m sure there d be sideeffects there always are but it seems the preferable route to me
AH haha the amount of stupid in your logic is nearly unfathomable
NONE psychiatry is not a hard science so your point is meaningless
AH wow reading all your comment in this you sound like quite the super douche

AH get a load of this guy over here military over here everyone look at this guy he s got annual training everybody stop whatever you are doing and have a look at what this guy is saying this is serious this is military business over here everyone just stop and look at this this is a humorous remark made and not one that in any way promotes hostility for any reason i just do nt see alcohol consumption being an automatic consent retraction nobody doe where are you getting that idea from
NONE i see your view ha already been changed but i ll make my final argument for the hell of it so if we agree that woman and minority face oppression even if it could be worse like it is in other part of the world it s totally reasonable for people to address it a a real problem and try to fix it just like steve and fixing his car in an ideal world joshes car get fixed too and everyone can drive but it s unreasonable for steve to not try and fix his car just because he know it could be worse
AH you still do nt seem to be attempting to change op s view at all i suppose i should have been focusing more on making it seem like i had no interest what so ever in engaging in meta commentary on my post perhaps then you would have passed me by have i hounded your post in other thread discussing tactic and jacking myself off over the spirit of cmv no then please do me the same kindness and refrain from here on out
NONE are you saying people will use the disliked tab to look up post they really liked but downvoted just to get it stored there it seems to have perfectly legitimate us like let s say i see someone post a scientific study that s horribly overreaching in it conclusion or a political article that i find outrageous i downvote it and later look it up on my disliked tab to show a friend i wanted to tell about it
AH if we re going to acknowledge idiocy let me point out some of yours that is just absolutely wrong and us no logic whatsoever so we have a claim they used no logic not just no logic but no logic whatsoever now let s fast forward to your contradiction that is an absolutely idiotic statement to say that because he is opposite on issue that he s bad for the country based on that logic alone what logic they did nt use any logic whatsoever now enough patronizing let me be productive now with an enlightening insight poor logic is still logic it doe nt make good sense to say that if someone used poor logic then therefore they did nt use logic at all that s misunderstanding the concept of logic or it s showing how little effort you re putting into your statement when you say that or both another protip stay away from term a negative a idiocy at least in discussiondebateargument i would have loved to correct you in a more mature way that did nt include any condescension but sometimes i like to reflect tone just for the principle
NONE i think we re saying the same thing peterson s point a i understand it is that passing law to curtail free speech in order to change the meaning of or to create new word is authoritarian he is nt refusing to do so to hurt his student feeling he is refusing to do so because the government is censoring his speech his point is that giving in here is how country and culture previously fell to authoritarianism doctrine your point in refusing to use preferred pronoun in situation where biological sex is irrelevant or you believe the pronoun to be malicious is well i do nt know for sure and i do nt want to put word in your mouth but you have a point in putting that line in the sand even if it s just after this point we re getting absurd and going offtopic both of you take a stance for your own reason and to make your own point absolutely we can disagree on the validity reasonableness or logic behind those point but you re not just arbitrarily drawing a line and even if you have to argue about it you re not doing it just to be pointlessly combative
AH thinking that trump ultimate goal is to take control of the country and override democracy is so idiotic i ca nt even articulate it properly similarly your view of the people who voted trump are of that same mindset is equally insane you are so confused about the state of thing that you could nt even start to make reliable inference i ll just jump to the meat of the topic and reassure you that islam is not a threat to america islamic terror is not a threat you are the threat you embolden enemy by calling them victim and then you undermine security measure that look to protect against the effect of your initial treason any successful attack on america is the fault of you and people like you equally any right we lose in the process the one thing trump supporter all seem to have in common is a lack of interest in your virtue signalling
NONE your first paragraph is refuted by the fact that those agreement are not what make something rightwrong they are just codification of that which we know is right and wrong the content of those agreement have moral weight independent of the fact that they were written down in those agreement your second paragraph is refuted by the fact that terrorism is a massively ineffective way of achieving your goal and thus anyone who act a though it will gain them their desire is in fact killing people fruitlessly the third paragraph is refuted by the statement live and let live your right to freedom of religion stop when it impinges on other people s freedom the fact that you want to kill people because of your religion doe not then mean that your right to religious freedom justifies that other people have right to life which trump your right to religious freedom
AH lmao you ca nt be serious
NONE but why should nt they

NONE another way to look at it is that the easy life is nt very fulfilling it s not worth a much and you get what you pay for do you really want to be the type of person who complains about trivial thing or who is flippant or is not self sufficient enough to stand on their own two foot but continually get help from others like a charity case there is not much genuine pride and selfesteem in an easy life the ecstasy of success and achievement correlate with how much you worked for it deserved it struggled and bled for it if edmund hillary had been helicoptered to the top of everest it would have cheapened the conquest
AH http wwwredditcomrtodayilearnedcommentssndbtilthatdaryldavisablackmusicianiscredited this is insanely hypocritical you re here spouting your theory that for every such person who change hisher view there ll be three more such people who would vociferously defend their idea and that is what allows the prominence of such trait in our society and you seem to be defending this pretty vociferously now where is your data that say that this is true what defines a negative belief what is wrong with supremacism racism etc where do you draw the line would you recommend the extermination or sterilization of people that hold a negative belief you sound quite like a nazi to me
NONE the problem with view like this is that they re intuitive what apart from semantic preciousness can anyone say that could possibly change your view you can adlib any ethical philosophy you want into your post and the evidence supporting it that you find the result of that philosophy when applied intuitively correct would remain exactly the same the reason you give for why your view is correct are equally true for literally every other morality that could ever exist even one in direct opposition to your own if i were to make a similar post claiming that a vehement racist who kept their bigotry to themself were still a bad person the only way you could respond would be to tell me that my philosophy doe nt seem correct to you do you think i would find that convincing
AH i do nt often get into kissing match or try to troll people so please take my word a serious and sincere i think that anyone who would agree with you lack any honour at all she saw your soldier doing something criminal and she let the world know because otherwise there would have been zero consequence and no one would have known the thing she saw were disgusting the action of those soldier were disgusting and murder the fact you do nt care make you a disgraceful human being with no honour the only danger she put you in wa having people hate soldier for being murderer if there is some other thing she did that put you in danger then i would like to hear about it but so far the only thing she did wa not keep her mouth shut when she saw soldier murder people not keeping your mouth shut when you see murder is honourable doing it when the perpetrator were soldier of the most powerful nation on the planet is the single most courageous act i can think of since america is the single most powerful enemy to have in the world please explain to me how exposing murder is somehow anything but an honourable and courageous act
NONE you may be apathetic to him exiting this world but do you see no value in him still being able to interact with his sister and parent perhaps there were young kid that he positively influenced his criminality say nothing of how he positively impacted at least some portion of humanity i do nt think any of u know the circumstance of his life and his criminal record well enough to categorically state he offered nothing to humanity second do you think the murder or manslaughter of people you judge a scummy piece of shit is acceptable if so where doe that line get drawn in the future i think that s the exact reason people are protesting i talk of the peaceful lawabiding protester freddie gray may not have been a perfect person in this world but that doe nt mean he should have been killed or any of u needed to help him leave this world last your viewpoint leaf no space for anyone who made a mistake to be able to make reparation and actually contribute positively to society what if he went to jail and got out could he potentially contribute to the world at that point no one know the answer to that and to conclude the world is better off with him gone is reckless

AH oh gosh you got my number there i could nt have possibly seen someone picking up the most obvious pathetic and short sided thread in my post and yanking on it desperately a though it would lead somewhere that s why i did nt include a paragraph like this none of these show are above reproach of course if that s what you re trying to get at always sunny in particular i almost stopped watching after or episode featured rape joke that i thought were in very poor taste but most of them when they delve into race gender sex or other touchy subject do so with an interesting and inventive angle and all of them are written by people who i know for the most part are inteligent well meaning folk with solid understanding of the issue that their comedy address so it s ok if they make a mistep or two gosh i wish i had the i might have been able to retort with something like there s a difference between racial and racist and unicorns are fluffy and beautiful but i did nt include a paragraph like that too bad better iamanbie
NONE sure i think more of what we are a individual is nurture than we like to admit when we re young we experience all kind of stuff that shape u into the person we are that doe nt mean it s a choice what kind of person we became or what thing we prefer it s difficult to explain this without it seeming like a negative thing though because the most apparent and commonly accepted example are trauma related i started wondering about this because i m gay myself and i ve noticed a very common family situation with a lot of gay guy i know the lack of a strong father figure either they have single mother or very overbearing mother and weak father that s anecdotal i know but it seems like in this conversation it s completely ignored on the other hand when a girl ha daddy issue it s commonly accepted she had a rough relationship with her father if one at all a girl like that is nt born that way but it s not a choice for her to be like that either maybe the problem with that scenario is people think it is a choice i do nt know if gay are born that way but it s like a taboo to even talk about it and it really should nt matter
AH i never said what my view on the issue were so you can stop being so presumptuous also i m not sure if you re aware of this but your tone is not very good for conducting a rational argument in both this comment and in the comment i initially replied to you sounded condescending a shit if you can not communicate respectfully then you will only make yourself sound like a prick no one hears what you have to say if you re being an asshole while you re saying it no matter how right you may be and i m not saying that the way the first person in this comment chain view the subject is the right way i m saying that the argument the dictionary say something different so you ca nt use the word that way a sentiment also found in the op is logically flawed because the dictionary doe not define how you are able to use word the people who say the word define that
NONE a someone who absolutely love debating with people i have actually found that something completely opposite to what you are saying is often true keyword often not always and that is if you are attacking someone s right to say what they are saying it s probably because you do nt know how to refute what they are saying which can be rephrased a if free speech can be used a a legitimate defense the other person is probably grasping at straw to give an example if person a present a genuine opinion say they think that the u military get far too much respect from it citizen if b say something along the line of how could you say that these people risk their life for you and you try to blow them off like this then person a can respond i have free speech and a right to my opinion person b ha not actually said anything that could make person a wrong in fact in this case although i would nt necessarily generalize this part person b ha actually exemplified person a s opinion by jumping to defend soldier
AH you re delusional i m not going to sit here and encourage you to exercise logic when your priority are elsewhere you know what you said about music you know now that your hemisphere argument is ludicrous and frankly i do nt really care if your ego allows you to admit it google further if you want to http wwwdailymailcouksciencetecharticlearerightbrainedcreativeleftbrainedlogicalyoureclaimsstudylinkbrainsidespersonalitynonsensehtml
NONE give away all of your belonging give away all of your money quit your job do nothing with your life and cut all tie with people you love if you truly feel the way you do you would have already done those thing but there is obviously something you are holding on to for what reason are you holding on to those thing if they have no meaning to you from what i see you truly do nt need your view changed a you truly do nt seem to believe everything is worthless
AH they can press criminal charge if they feel reasonably threatened no i could not press charge against somebody for calling me a nigger you are mistaken you are wrong woman being catcalled can only press civil suit in certain case and have never been able to press criminal charge you should never be able to press criminal charge for the word another person ha said that s what free speech protects actually unless you can make a legal case for purposeful harassment and then provide proof and evidence to support your case any rational law enforcement agent will laugh in your fucking face it s really fucking pathetic that you compare people who allegedly catcall to klansman burning cross one is terrorism the other is verbal communication with good intention on behalf of the alleged harasser and not malicious intent to cause terror only the most absurd moronic ludicrous idiot would even dare compare catcalling to terrorism that make you a fucking idiot you realize that right you literally just compared catcalling giving unsolicited compliment to stranger to terrorism burning cross on lawn i think people a stupid a you should be sterilized
NONE first of all the fifth amendment includes much more than the right to avoid selfincrimination i assume this is all you mean however it s good for avoiding torture you ca nt be tortured into confessing if you have the right not to confess this is probably the historical reason for the right not to selfincriminate sometimes the police will ask very leading question and you may fear that almost any answer to those question will then incriminate you despite being innocent the police can testify that you said an answer with some kind of sneer or showed nervousness or failed to register surprise etc it s useful to have the right not to talk this is probably the most common use of the right to avoid selfincrimination it is also useful during trial to avoid fishing you may not be guilty of the crime you are charged with but nevertheless not want to give information that incriminates you regarding other crime perhaps you are innocent of murder but do nt want to go to jail for drug possession admittedly this is le useful than the pretrial us described above after all refusing to answer question during the trial often make one look pretty guilty
AH you may be fully aware of what it mean but i do nt think you understand what it mean you re sounding a little sociopathic i ve lost loved one in the past that i ve shared incredibly impactful memory with life changing moment in my life those memory do nt die with the individual that i shared them with those memory are very much alive and still affect me to this day
NONE but what doe it mean to make a better effort to remember thing i for example have awful memory along with many others in my family i ca nt change my genetics or how my brain poorly store memory it s difficult to work on fixing such a subtle mental problem unless you mean doing thing like calendar s and reminder what you re asking could be like asking a handicapped man to walk it off

AH state controlled medium vast military expansion strictly enforced patriotism support and enforcement of an ethno state that resorted to genocide use of the other to garner support of the people the nazi were right wing and the fact that you wo nt admit it show you to be either without any intellectual rigor or a willfully ignorant troll you are nt clever and you ve changed no mind
NONE in colloquial use the term terrorism generally refers to attempt to intimidate the public in this case their main political action is the sofar nonviolent act of occupying a building that is nt critical for daily public life yes they are threatening violence to anyone who try to arrest them but they are nt saying that they ll start killing people if the federal government doe nt renounce it claim on the land

AH i suggest you do some research on aa before you comment further the stated goal of aa is to create diversity similar to the population and if you d ever done any research that s the first thing you d have found out which indicates you have nt done any research that doe not connote racial quota i just cringed at your total lack of reading comprehension great job repeating what she said and then attacking her for not doing research that s just a racial stereotype what s your evidence for that now you re just trolling to be contrarian there is a metric ton of evidence of this and you look like a fool for not doing a basic google search to look this up before your hackneyed retort of burden of evidence is not on me just look up average sat score percentage of asian at top university and note that the percentage should be higher if we were merely picking from a black box of stats ec activity no legacy and aa average mcat score etc
NONE yeah there are a ton of caveat and difference across all of those country to your point it s hard to get a really applestoapples comparison due to all of the policy difference through the educational system not to mention wealth and other social difference you re correct that the best triangulation point would be to find a country that used to not offer free higher education and only started in the past few decade i have nt been able to find any good example of this though it s definitely worth researching but to continue the thought experiment a different way do you think that public education up to any level ha a detrimental effect on the middle class for example if i were to make your same argument about high school would you feel differently if so what s the distinction
AH god you embody the smug fart smelling sf attitude south park could nt have been more accurate
NONE i just could nt believe anyone would choose pita over glen damn those hemsworths just too beautiful

AH his idea are not worth debating with he is right on some of his point like the wage gap myth how school are catered towards woman etc not debating with those idea is a bad thing regressive white nationalist boom where is the proof he is a white nationalist if debating is pointless then at least let me express my contempt for this contemptible person by calling them a nazi that is really stupid and really dangerous i do nt like this person so i ll call them a nazi so other people do nt like this person the other thing is you re underestimating the extent to which it s a common badfaith argument to come in and play semantic nitpicker about exactly what horrible belief a specific person ha it is unbelievably moronic to come in and overstate another person belief by calling them a racist nazi the guy is contemptible that is for sure but he is a gay jew who had a black muslim boyfriend i do nt think a nazi really enjoys any of those thing it also destroys any real argument you have because you are disingenuous from the very beginning
NONE ton of people actually believe that lot of people believe that racism is over and that black people no longer face societal oppression and that now calling someone a cracker is literally just a bad a calling someone the n word and it sounded like op belief this considering they put privileged in quote a if privilege is nt a real thing anyways if someone actually agrees that some group are privileged and others are oppressed then i have to wonder are thing like cisphobia and reverse racism really problem that we need to be spending our time on like are these thing genuinely harming anyone or causing any real ill in society trans people are literally getting murdered in the street for being trans but no let s spend our time complaining about some cisphobic joke we saw on tumblr even though if someone is making a joke against ci people it s probably because that person is trans and ha experienced real oppression for that their entire life it s not cool to compare the anger of the oppressed to the violence of the oppressor

NONE i wa very similar to you in high school i judged my friend who drank underage who tried drug who had sex etc i think a lot of it came from the fact that we re taught from a young age that these thing are wrong and bad what ended up changing my view on these issue wa a willingness to be more tolerant of people s individuality and imperfection we are all flawed we all make bad decision sometimes that s not an excuse for bad behavior but it s pretty hypocritical to judge other people too harshly for theirs yes smoking is bad for you i do nt know why anyone would start it s unhealthy and highly addictive and i think it s a pretty stupid choice to become a smoker that said i do plenty of thing that are unhealthy i do nt eat a well a i should i have been telling myself i m going to get back in shape for year i stay inside letting my depression get the better of me even when i know i should go for a walk and at least try to reset my system who am i to judge others for smoking

AH all of those thing you just said are simply untrue you are either ignorant or willfully stupid be an organ donor you fuck or do nt i do nt really care but justify your opinion with something that s based on well reality and not your deluded imagination of medical undergrad playing foodfight with human liver i like that image personally i hope my organ could be used for such a lighthearted activity if they are nt useful for somebody
NONE well one can not want to sleep with them for religious reason or other reason for example and now you are appending the term free to your definition could you provide any evidence on the supposed linkage because i m not seeing how a sexual act is related socially if you rape someone it s free you are nt a virgin but i d argue you are deficient in social skill or do nt care about social norm depending on if you were confused about a lack of consent or did nt care
AH you are incredibly naive
NONE ok you are incomprehensible
AH do nt let the door hit you on the way out
NONE if you do nt like america here s the door
AH right back at ya i m not the one confused a to why people are continuously responding to my post on a discussion forum it seemed you did nt understand what these website are designed for but sense you now know there s no more need to wonder why you keep getting response i m curious a to whether that matter it s clear that you were hell bent on berating me into some sort of submission regardless posting counterarguments berating someone into submission if that s how you think of counterarguments then perhaps you should not hang in sub centered around debate why you picked my particularly unnoteworthy thread is unclear plenty of people were a mistaken a you were i responded to your post because it happened to be one of the top post in the thread at the time but it fell onto me and i bore it until i had nothing left to respond to your incessant and unyielding repetition of the same fucking point that i could nt give a shit le about why would you post in a thread if you do nt care about hearing opposing position is it that you only care about response so long a they agree with your position in that case you might be better off in one of the political subreddits than this sub from there all that s left is nonsequiturs and abuse until you leave me alone and hopefully remember the experience so that in the future you avoid engaging with me again interesting neat what else you want to know when you have your little tantrum do you sincerely believe that you still have justification for your position or do you realize that you never had any support if the former why not post that justification rather than behaving like a child if the latter do the tantrum act a a distraction from admitting that you were wrong what s the motivation behind the internet tantrum
NONE i m having some trouble understanding exactly what it is you re presenting so i ll take something you said from the comment and guess this is more emotionally based i feel like it an uncomfortable and giant burden to latch on all your problem to someone else when you d have to face them yourself yes it s true that they can help me with my problem but i do nt want to create a habit that i have to depend on others for my own problem sharing problem you re having doe nt mean you have to latch all of them on anyone it seems like it s difficult for you to perhaps see there is moderation in this here just talking about thing doe nt nessarily mean you re being a burden and asking someone to solve the problem often people just need someone to listen just needing a willing ear is nt being a burden and a long a you re using moderation and not turning someone into a crutch that vulnerability is even an important part of friendship all im saying is that at a mentality standpoint it would be better not to rely on others because independence is always with you no matter what stage of life and the people you can put your heart out to will come and go independence i ve found the older i get is such a lie to get any job whoever sign your paycheck the person who hook up your gas and electricity all of those little thing everyone depends on they depend on others a we get old if we might become immobile one day it s like there s shame to admitting we ca nt do it alone there s no shame in being apart of society that s really what it is when it come down to it part of being in society is friendship part of a good friend is someone you can rely on and yes they come and go this is normal the only promise of life is that it s always changing is it better to let fear that someone might grow apart from you or leave dictate your life and deny you the joy of friendship and meeting new people
AH i think you re making an unfair comparison here first of all the effort that you have to make is minimal to move to the left lane second of all you should be traveling in the left lane anyway unless there is someone going under the speed limit that you need to pas third this person that doe want to pas you is nt causing you direct harm there s certainly the argument that they are increasing the risk of accident for other people on the road but there s a huge difference between going kph in a kph zone and going kph in a kph zone you re not helping someone steal property and harm someone else you re allowing someone that s in a hurry to get where they re going without being a burden you ca nt possibly know the reason they are driving fast they may just be a jerk they may just have no respect for the law maybe they have to get to the bank before it close to deposit their check before it overdraft making them short on their mortgage payment again they may be late for a job interview because their child is sick and threw up all over their suit and the babysitter wa late and they really need this job because their child is really sick you re being presumptive and frankly you re coming off a the jerk for causing a stink and trying to take some sort of arbitrary moral high ground it s none of your business why this person is choosing to drive faster than you and you re not going to make anything any better or change anyone s mind by intentionally getting in the way the only outcome is that the person will get frustrated you wo nt change their mind but you could certainly make them mad
NONE it s true that there s an undeniably large black market for gun but i doubt that the people who are committing most of these medium covered mass shooting would be in the position to or even know how to take advantage of it the vast majority of shooting death are in disadvantaged urban area and yes there s very little that gun control would do to curb that problem it s a social and economic issue that no one really seems willing to discus with a level head but that s tangential to your argument i d say a passable analogy for the argument against the point you re making come from alcoholism if you have an alcoholic with a six pack of beer in the house eventually they re going to drink it whether or not they want to relapse if they re trying hard to avoid hurting themselves and the people around them perhaps they can manage the self control to avoid going to the liquor isle or the local dive bar but if a drink is staring at them every time they open the fridge it ll be more difficult if you take ten alcoholic a certain percentage will go to the bar if they ve had a rough day but an even larger percentage will succumb to the temptation in their fridge that s why aa recommends having a dry home now that s obviously not a perfect analogy but the point is the more work it take to do something unacceptable the fewer people will do it deep down it s very close to literally all of u that have a voice telling u not to go out and kill people i suspect that gun control would make that voice easier to listen to by removing the siren singer voice of the cool looking ar you can buy at your local walmart
AH you re either trolling me or delusional the problem is that they can and do take your money without any connection to criminal activity
NONE you re not wrong taxation is theft no individual ha the right to take your money so how can many individual through voting delegate a right they do not have to another entity
AH oh cool so you agree with me it would nt protect people trying to opt out of paternity test reading comprehension is nt your strong suit is it lol http caselawfindlawcomussupremecourthtml next time you try to claim that the free exercise clause doe nt apply try citing a case that actually mention the free exercise clause
NONE what is your opinion on thoughtcrime could the government hypothetically arrest me before i commit a crime if they think they can prove i intended to also how doe your legal system deal with negligence my intent wa to pick my phone up off the floor of my car not to hit that pedestrian so i should walk free according to your reasoning
AH none of the link you provided outline a single gender role exhibited by baby difficulty focusing is not a gender role being slightly more advanced in sensory and cognitive way are not gender role
NONE another testament to the power of language luckily there are many people working to continue clarifying the difference between sex and gender the term gender identity is a handy transition tool
AH a fucking cucumber would obviously make a better president than trump i m not interested in speaking to the mental midget that somehow still think a relentlessly compulsively lying disturbingly erratic laughably thin skinned halfwitted hystrionic megalomaniacal narcissist full of hateful divisive antiquated idea wa a better choice than an insipid establishment centrist like hillary when that he wa ever even considered even capable of the job by so many ha been utterly baffling from the start have fun with that if you d like to waste your time trying to burst the bubble of people who will protect theirs to the death some of u would rather focus on practical solution focused on what the large majority can actually do to make sure these lunatic do nt completely roll back year of progress no that they are in charge through a fluke of unintentional gerrymandering foreign intervention and the criminal failure of the electoral college to do their only job which is explicitly to prevent the kind of dangerous populist fascist movement that elected trump from actually gaining power
NONE i think the issue is that if we were to livestream everyone s life we would find that almost everyone ha had some incident where they acted in a way that make them look really bad for the most part the consequence of such act are pretty small some people feel bad you feel like a fool afterwards and hopefully do nt make the exact same mistake again but the fact of recording everything and posting it for public consumption with little if any context is adding wildly disproportionate consequence to the harm caused by bad behavior losing one s job can be absolutely terrible especially if it happens in a way that make finding another job difficult or impossible you re talking about someone possibly going bankrupt losing their home and essentially ceasing to be a productive member of society or at least ceasing to be a productive a they were before doing that because someone make a fool of themselves with a parking attendant is an absurd overreaction the actual consequence of such an incident are quite small in comparison to the consequence of doxxing or publicly shaming the person
AH so how s your reading comprehension
NONE did i change your view in that case
AH fucking racist piece of shit
NONE nra is indeed full of shit
AH dude i m up voting you because i want others to see you a an example of how stupid you are
NONE i think we have to dispell with the notion that the rubio campaign know what they are doing
AH i ll agree that my argument wa poor that said your counterargument is both combative and lazy you could have articulated the point or at least written your own cmv but to criticize without providing any actual value just make you a troll
NONE of course that make up for a part of it and i have stated inconvenience a a reason for piracy in my previous post but people who do nt have enough digital money can hardly be classified a poor a such it completely change your original argument
AH stop being thick i am not talking about being stranded on a desert island and i do nt plan on being so any time soon so your point is moot
NONE do i really have to stand up and walk foot i wont to that to get the remote when something i hate is on this is a much le serious situation
AH you do nt have to answer this question in fact blink twice for yes and one for no but are you high

NONE you re not banned from a sub you re banned from posting in a sub semantic argument i know but it look like the question of this argument rest on semantics you can still participate and you can not simultaneously want and have something your participation is merely relegated to that of consumption only
AH would forcing someone to continue suffering for your own happiness not be even more selfish you really think someone who just got dumped should be supported in the idea to kill themselves over it the fuck is wrong with you the only way i support assisted suicide is in the case of a terminal illness depression is not a terminal illness it s just people sad for no reason who wo nt get the fuck over it because they re enabled by everyone else around them telling them they ca nt get over it i wa depressed and i got over it with no med and no therapy if i can do it with no help i m sure the majority of people can do it with help suicide is the ultimate in selfishness there is nothing else more selfish than ending your existence permanently over a temporary problem and i refuse to entertain the stupid notion that it should advocated for
NONE but you know that you will die and that people you love will die absolutely that doe nt mean suffering i do nt view death a suffering at all it s just the natural end to life why would death be suffering my love of people doe nt stop death that would be ridiculous for me to think it would and that everything you achieved is meaningless not true in all point of view if my child have a more fulfillingbetter life because of my work then it meant the world to me maybe not to you just because suffering is plausible doe nt mean the purpose is that would be like saying the purpose of building a car is to break down it is plausible that everyone s car will break down at some point but their car still serf another purpose to them even if it will still likely break down
AH not if he s saying that the government should serve nobody and just enforce some very limited law the government wa established to serve the people this is such a monumentally stupid argument i do nt even know where to begin why should it limit disparity between rich and poor because capitalist society make the life of some inherently more valuable than the life of others people are born into squalor or wealth and they can do almost nothing to change that even with regulation so is that one of those theoretical form of communism a opposed to the real but really shitty form of communism it s not just theoretical it s actually been instituted in the past in place such a catalonia it also exists currently in rojava a semiautonomous region in syria you can never put selfishness aside it motivates every action we undertake that s true of a capitalist society but it doe nt have to be the case no i m saying let not take people shit by force and give it to other people why do nt we let people give that shit away instead you said if yourself selfishness can not be put aside in a capitalist system by saying that you are fundamentally acknowledging that charity is not nor will it ever be sufficient to deal with society s problem
NONE imagine that thing are going terribly wrong in a country and that only one candidate give an explanation of what is the source of the problem immigration and china and that only he is arguing he can solve it wall and protectionism saying that it s simple but that it need only political courage to reach it do american really deserve to have a president that would turn their country into a dictatorship at first there is a problem the problem becomes everything it s easy to be wrong to distrust any other explanation to doubt anything the establishment say and it supporter it s easy to mistake when we think we know the truth we do it a lot of time your perception is limited by what you want to see but i do nt want to excuse mistake like this but i also want to say that each time extremism came to be wa because population wa greatly annoyed that it may be for economic reason political ideologic or increasing inequality what i mainly want to say is that people do nt rise for a charismatic character when they dont have any valid reason to do so so did hitler became elected because people were dumb or because germany wa suffering a deep crisis intensified by the versailles treaty it wa easy to hate european country for german
AH no i did nt save them thanks my autocorrect is more efficient than your overbearing meddlesome need to lecture the wonderful difference is it doe nt have a shrill tedious voice to discus thing with me in
NONE here s some unsolicited marketing advice that will probably net you a bit more money than your terrible current scheme you approach everyone and say in a gruff voice that you re going to hug them unless they pay you €
AH but why ca nt the line drawn be drawn at murder why could it be that rape and misogyny produce vehement reaction of outrage in people thus making them effective tool just like murder and general violence nah art should just cater to my sociopolitical view this is just another example in a long list of movie tv and book depiction of how difficult it is to have your woman be assaulted by someone else fucking please this is so fucking reaching it s his fucking family you fucking nitwit yes this ha a vague resemblance to some trope you can say prof the fucking patriarchy in the same way that cottage cheese is whipped cream ed oh and to the premise of the topic there s a difference between being offended and criticizing using offense a a tool of criticism is what people are taking issue with
NONE thanks for engaging actually i think we might be getting a tiny bit off track yes i think the core issue is the definition of rape but i do nt disagree with you that there s rape and then there s rape the birthdayboy and sadistic rapist are definitely on completely different level but it s a matter of degree and i want to put out there the idea that most rape except perhaps for the most brutal sadistic outlier case stem from the same place ie a deeply institutionalized and imbalanced power dynamic to be blunt about it men fuck woman and woman get fucked that attitude may seem benign to you and me because we re good guy right but consider that this culture surrounding sex can be unhealthy at best violent at worst sort of along the line eriophora http wwwredditcomusereriophora describes
AH no one owes you sex you piece of shit
NONE no one disagrees with you on this sorry

AH also to my knowledge no one ha ever been even hurt from punch to the top of the head during a shot you clearly know nothing about anatomy and physiology so please do nt embarrass yourself by trying to talk about thing you know nothing about not to mention you keep ignoring the strength difference it doe nt matter that rousey is good at judo the fact is that even if the fight went to the ground mayweather is so much stronger than her that he would ruin her there anyways
NONE could nt someone just masturbate prone before you go to work yeah but your main point about doing so prone seemed to be that it wa more pleasurable this way than upright way what i m saying is that sometimes pleasure felt in masturbation is secondary to the purpose of simply canceling out the negative effect of sexual frustration later on some men are nt masturbating to do what feel the best they re doing it in whatever way is most convenient for them just to get it out of the way and move on with their day
AH what is typical libertarian argument that all tax are bad and that the fed gov should nt do anything while simultaneously accepting farm subsidy and driving on federally financed road did i get it alex
NONE how is military budget a counterpoint to show how wasteful speeding camera are that s completely irrelevant i d prefer to tell congress to fund neither because they are booth poor roi on human life
AH well why do nt you go and find some people to read it and then feed their opinion back to you so you can stroke your ego
NONE i completely agree do nt change your view they do it so you can see the change but it just slide everywhere and you ca nt put it in your pocket or wallet easily
AH who give a shit are you implying that people in the military are somehow more moral than civilian why would you think about implementing national conscription just so you can knock some humility into some people it completely idiotic you re trying to correct a perceived moral problem that doe nt even exist
NONE could you explain how you think institutional racism came into existence i d argue that racial prejudice is the cause of institutional racism if people did nt make these quick judgement for example black people are nt smart enough to vote then there would nt have been a problem with allowing black people to vote and turning it into an institutional problem
AH hey hitler did nt realize you browsed this subreddit
NONE touche ca nt complain with you on this topic sadly
AH edit since this is cmv i guess i ll have to explain why i disagree with you you re just lazy it ha nothing to do with not wanting kid strawman argument where s your evidence arguing semantics i ve made my position quite clear throughout this entire argument that i do nt want kid that underachievement is a perspective based label from the outsider s perspective and that i do nt see underachievement a defined by others a bad when you are nt trying to start a family instead you assure me i m just lazy an extremely baseless assertion attaching a negative connotation to my opinion a if shaming me is going to invoke some sort of socratic response and tell me i m posthoc rationalizing my opinion also based off of nothing projecting your reality onto another and assuming it s universal example gym rat who ca nt wrap their brain around someone not wanting to be lbs and body fat because they personally do nt so rationalizes that anyone not striving for are just being lazy you re a waste of time you re not worth arguing with anymore
NONE i ve read a few of your comment below responding to other poster and i can only say i agree with you regardless of all the downvotes you are getting you are being nuanced over the matter you are not saying a mental illness is just somebody not trying hard enough you are basically saying if i understand correctly labeling certain behavior a disease is giving quite some people an excuse to not even try to better themselves and i ll go one step further i think quite a few diagnosis on depression and even autismrelated diagnosis are dished out way to easily without regard for the actual cause of the problem and trying to solve the problem you already mention doug stanhope somewhere and when i first heard his bit about aa i thought it wa verrrryyyy edgy but also found myself completely agreeing with him this is the bit http wwwyoutubecomwatch vuygdoecqpe if you re an alcoholic i ll bet out of time you have issue with how you deal with emotion and life s setback and you should address those problem i think it is inherently wrong to think that god or aa or whoever will save you if that s your starting point you re setting yourself up for relapse there s only one person who can save you and that is you take control of your life usually i m a nuanced guy but it s nice to vent every now and then
AH trump chump keep coming back and pontificating about thing he doe nt understand enjoy i m sure you thrive on this you would if you voted for trump please lol every vote matter the fact that you do nt know that show how little you really know hillary won the popular vote lololol your president is a fraud and the product of a broken system a broken president from a broken system make perfect sense these next four year will prove a much and you ll be on the wrong side of history and when you finally realize that liberal are smarter than you than you can get back to your light beer and your reality tv show because that s your life want to talk fact unemployment is from a high of during obama s tenure obama led this country during the one of the worst financial crisis in american history and gave you conservative a stable economy to work with lol son you have no idea what you re talking about frankly i could do this all day but please keep coming back and prove that you need my approval because you know i m smarter than you i am and always will be the better man period
NONE am i crazy no but you do nt really have a good grasp of how republican think republican tend to be fierce individualist who believe in free will so from their point of view if you grew up poor and are making bad decision in your life you can at any time choose to make better decision and turn your life around now maybe you do nt agree with them on this point and that s fine but knowing this should help shine a better light on some of the thing they do if you re trying to start up a business republican are going to do what they can to keep the government out of your fucking way so that you can actually succeed democrat would accuse them of going too far in that regard but you get the point by and large republican are trying to get u back to a time where family and faith were the center of everything and made in america actually meant something you may say and i would agree that they go too far in trying to legislate morality and such but that doe nt make them evil people they simply have a different view of how to get to prosperity than democrat do a for the racism accusation i ll let sam harris speak on that point http wwwyoutubecomwatch vjaaxtzbbvi ts
AH how do you make a thread in a free thinking sub saying you re impressed and confident in hillary clinton a a leader and expect no dissent or discussion about it leave out the shillary if you do nt want it to be pertinent to discussion

NONE ok but it s not like they re hiding this they re reporting the super tiny risk and a long a you re not someone who just let people stick you with needle then you should know the risk i do nt understand why you should be able to sue them it s not negligence they re telling you these are the side effect of course they are trying to make it safer imagine if you were the first company to say you ve reduced side effect people would only use your vaccine there no need to force them to strive for better product
AH charity is disgusting i find those who do charity are taking more than they give and what the fuck have you done today call capitalist name man what a valuable contribution to society go fuck yourself

AH yes you ve explained that the answer is pretentious and uninformed
NONE out of all the cmv i ve seen this is perhaps the most frivolous
AH i doubt the validity of that statement not that the truth is that important to someone of your intellectual fortitude
NONE and the argument to that is that it is nt possible to determine that with any degree of certainty so we air on the side of caution
AH that is a relationship right there a correlation exists we can call that a correlation no it s not a relationship beyond an apparent statistical one for fuck s sake watch the simpson clip thats correlation and it s just a asinine a yours lgbt acceptance also correlate with rising global surface temperature doe that also mean that in warm weather people hate the gay le that s the level of correlation you re pulling here seriously take a statistic course this is ridiculous you literally do nt know what correlation is literally no idea pride event very clearly do nt have such a negative impact that they re causing a downward trend of acceptance no one said or even implied that what the hell are you talking about i wa nt countering with shit because i m not playing the fallacy game with you it s bullshit reddit stuff and you have no idea what you re even talking about logic is bullshit reddit stuff k den you know fallacy are just a short concise way of pointing out flawed reasoning right i mean p
NONE now i m far from a conservative but i m only confident about that because i take them seriously the idea that edmund burke can be dismissed with a three paragraph wikipedia page that asset that tradition ha no value is quite frankly silly to begin with you need to understand where conservatism come from that mean burke and the french revolution it s true that every improvement start with a change but it s equally true that la terreur did a well change is risky when it go wrong it go very fucking wrong ultimately principled conservativism is a position of intellectual humility it s a recognition that we do nt really understand this machine called civilization and that perhaps we should take a deep breath before playing with the button no matter how good our intention are will legalising marijuana break the whole thing seems like no but big complex system react in some pretty crazy way overestimating how much you understand thing is a pretty big psychological bias too
AH people like you deserve what you get for being disingenuous
NONE honestly you have the right idea a far a im concerned
AH jesus h christ of your submission concern this topic you re like an anticircumcision zealot methinks you care way too much about this this is nt exactly in the top or even top issue that humanity need to address right now

AH not already famliar with your special use of it see this is the hilarious bit i m not using any special meaning of the word violence or force i m just applying it correctly to an area of life people are resistant to using it that s not special that s just telling it like it is then yes you are being disruptive why do you need to have this explained to you you re basically saying that unless you say what people are expecting to hear you are disruptive and that you should nt do that what kind of world do you live in i do nt care that your offended go ahead and be offended try reading comprehension i asked if you were offended i said nothing about being offended myself nor am i offended by what you say you really do need to stop being this way if you want to ever have anything like a constructive conversation outside the echo chamber you re used to you d be surprised the traction such language can have with people in real life and in person it s amazing how resistant most of reddit is to reality sometimes
NONE and if we equate action towards animal with those towards human are you saying your prediction is that i do nt do anything interesting with human either i think it s more like the way you treat those animal you re indifferent about may reflect on how you treat the humans you re indifferent about you re not indifferent towards your family or friend but how do you act towards random stranger or people that you meet briefly and you can tell that you just wo nt get on with them if you were rude towards someone with a pet oh my god do nt bring that thing into my house i d expect you could be similarly rude towards anyone else with another kind of difference in opinion or the opposite you said if someone put their cat in your lap you d still play with it or pet it even though you would nt appreciate it too much i think this actually reflects positively on you that you have some give and take with people even when they re doing something you do nt like that much or your interest do nt perfectly match

AH the entire point is that for someone attempting to put themselves above someone you re talking to you ve given exactly reasoning argumentation and proof in short you re a moron who think far too high of yourself get off that white horse and try to make an actual case for your opinion instead of sycophantically pronouncing your opinion correct cheer
NONE to explain think of it like the advice “ no one can make you angry only you can make you angry ” you are a rational actor in control of your emotion even if the stimulus exists to provoke anger that doesn ’ t mean you need to respond that way so even if the stimulus to change your mind like my awesome post is present it ’ s possible for a rational actor op to not change their mind because they are a rational actor

AH it s normal for abnormal to be taken a a negative so why fight it you ve answered your own debate abnormal ha a higher rate of being taken a a negative than a a positive that is easy to grasp and then you use the argument that it doe nt always mean negative even though the use case is almost always negative you re being stupid on purpose and that is annoying especially when you re claiming understanding and compassion if it s not on purpose than you have some barrier to understanding that you may have to face
NONE can you give me an example of something you believe is an end in and of itself if i disagreed and told you that it s not would you be able to tell me why it is the point i m trying to make is that when you question logical consistency itself you re hitting epistemic bedrock you can pick anything and claim there s no inherent benefit to it and the claim will always be unfalsifiable because if it s inherent then the benefit is the thing itself and providing a reason would reduce the thing to a mean to some external benefit

NONE you are ignoring the main problem with that post the post you linked to said that it wa the fault of the trans person if someone beat them because they are trans sure i agree that it s probably a good idea to tell your partner that your trans i do nt think trans people are obligated to do so but from an individualistic perspective it s probably safer and better to do so but the post you linked to said it wa the fault of trans people if they are beaten that is ridiculous and is transphobic

AH how exactly doe that make any sense you are removing something at birth that would have become much more a the kid grew you are either daft or a troll or have some type of cognitive dissonance but in either case you have certainly failed to make any point to support your case in this debate
NONE i ca nt think of any such example generally thing that have to be earned are not called right like a high school diploma i ca nt exactly find this distinction in any definition but it doe seem reasonable that while a right can be taken away initial access ca nt be behind a barrier

AH lol this faggot sorry mate but you re still creating the basis for visible problem with no actual evidence to support this this is essentially what you re saying this piece of paper moved from my desk to the floor when i wa out of my room and no one else could have moved it thus ghost exist what you are doing is the opposite of logic and it will lead to abundant social issue secondly several of your source are pure bogus or orchestrated academia created to push an agenda this is nt sinister it s because you think you re right and that s fine but you can not taint impartial science with this shit lastly fallacy of false metaphor in comparing the current state of the nation to past state of the nation with social parallel you seem to forget that back when everyone wa fucking racist science said racism wa okay now science say racism is not okay and anyone who doe is at odds with reality a a member of the fucking minority racist are a minority this is just selfevident tl dr grow the fuck up and learn logic

NONE i m talking about the ideology not the individual elsewhere in this thread you said even if government program are effective they are not compassionate it seems like you re saying that compassion can only be shown by individual but are rejecting the compassion of liberal individual because that s not actually part of the ideology do you think ideology can actually be compassionate what sort of evidence would convince you that one is

AH i do nt appreciate your hostile attitude never once did i say i expected everyone to cater to my feeling im just calling it like i see it if you interpret that a histile then tough titty and it s not about what you explicitly said it s about the implication and the implication in this post is that you want every to cater to your feeling because you are upset that you cant cover your favorite song without catching flak i m not trying to control what black people create or the music they make not trying to claim it a my own i understand who it wa made for do you actually know or do you think you know because i dont see why this question would even come up those who know what you claim to know already have the answer to this question it sound like you are trying to have your cake and eat it too my only question wa how a white person could cover a black song in celebration and good faith which i ve already had a discussion about and this is why i dont think you know what you claim to know because the answer to this question is painfully obvious whats going on here is that you want to be able to say the n word and you are trying to find way to rationalize your useage of the term unfortunately you cant and this is something you need to come to term with there is a radio version to just about every popular song and none of them use the word nigga so you have free reign to cover those with no issue at all and for song that dont have a radio version then just omit the word it that simple and it defintely doe not merit a whole reddit post over something this obvious lol

AH people in all form of medium other than child should be sexualized no one want to look at joe shmo or ugly cunt in video game or movie when you are playing a video game you want the character to be bad as or sexy thats not a bad thing you just hate it because people do nt like to look at frumpy ugly cunt like you

NONE in this sub there is another way of saying touché i guess it all boil down to a hypothetical you are given a choice start life over in a poor family or stop existing which would you choose my point is only that you should not argue that being born into a poor family is a disservice to the child because it is too hard a judgement call to make and because if asked the child would probably have been happy to be born
AH you re asking me to provide a quote to prove that i did nt say something which make no sense we can add this to the extensive list of evidence that you either do nt understand what you have read or ca nt remember what ha been said past the last comment also regarding all those run along remark that you keep making you will stop acting like an irate brat starting immediately will you stop acting like someone with a complete lack of reading comprehension allow me to use the power of copy and paste to remind you what i posted so you can replace those false memory if you disagree with this reading of direct quote please provide another direct quote from the same passage which a reasonable person can read a addressing the quality of the work performed in other word you ca nt provide a direct quote from the passage which prof my reading of your word wa wrong understood i did nt jump to conclusion i did nt misunderstand i did give you a chance to provide a direct quote from the scenario you wrote and you did nt you did nt because you could nt and rather than acknowledge that fact you tried to bury it with unrelated nonsense falsely sold a clearing up a misunderstanding i already left the door open for you to post a direct quote from your own passage you deflected you threw up distraction and i did nt buy any of it i have shown amazing patience with you stop dodging stop deflecting stop avoiding the reality that you presented a scenario that strictly focused on the amount of work rather than the quality or present a direct quote from the passage you wrote that prof me wrong i honestly ca nt dumb it down any more for you

AH you realize the only difference between the slowest and fastest metabolism is only about calorie a day right i do i read a comment where this wa the claim so i asked can you add any qualifier to that statement because i assure you my maintenance calorie exceed most people by more than you followed this with a snarky comment trying to make yourself out to be a lot smarter than you actually are at which point i asked you for a reference to back up the original claim you provided a website that not only did nt back up the original claim but refuted it quite strongly you have nothing to stand on here and look like a fucking tool most likely because you are one but i wo nt exclude the possibility of you just having a bad day
NONE so our rule to submit a cmv is that it must be over character in order to be allowed do you t this is the first character of your post not much more than your first sentence it doe nt give much room for anything but the briefest of explanation and if someone is sincerely following rule i d expect them to surpass it easily it seems like if someone would be put off by a character limit they should nt have awarded a delta in the first place i would expect the net to catch a few people with almost all willing and able to expand their comment a bit it s not a huge deal either way but i would nt expect it to make the system particularly prohibitive if implemented
AH to be honest it seems like you are getting all of your information about trump from meme nearly everything that you have to say about him is either entirely false wildly exagurated or taken out of context i might think that you were one of hillary s paid social medium shill but your post is a little bit too deranged even for them

NONE cmv the majority of american do nt actually care about their privacy actually people do care about their privacy it s just that they feel powerless to do anything about it the like of google et al would have you believe that this is a willing exchange that user are happy to make a small sacrifice to gain access to something but it seems that this is not actually the case what is actually happening is that internet user are throwing their hand up in surrender resigning themselves to the fact that they can do nothing to stop company from gathering data about them one and if it s going to happen why not use the service anyway from betanews http betanewscominternetusersarepowerlesstoprotecttheirprivacyandtheyknowit about a study conducted by upenn
AH why is my opinion or the other people in this thread that have been tricked le valid than yours their opinion is one that support tyranny and oppression that s all you need to say for me to realize that you are a zealot yes of course the right you happen to believe are desirable are therefore universally applicable and morally perfect and of course if i do nt really know what s best for me if my preference are objectively wrong you should step in and force everyone else to do what you want after all you re the one who is morally right in an objective way that is how tyranny happens people who think that they know what is best for everyone for all time there is no use arguing with people who think that they already know the one ultimate moral truth how can i possibly change your view when you stand on the brink and battle for the lord any argument that doe nt support what you already think is twisting meaning or tricking people anyone who doe nt agree with you must be blinded to the truth or convinced not to follow what if they could only see the one true light should be obvious to them your attitude is paternalistic a unilateral grant on objective moral truth to your own opinion at the expense of all others if you ca nt see that then i have nothing left to say to you
NONE if religious debate is pointless or not depends a lot on what you think the point should be if you think that it s actually about changing your debating partner mind then no that almost never happens but what if that s not the point perhaps there are a few side benefit here are some to consider it s not about convincing your opponent it s about convincing your shared audience maybe you re not even trying to change hisher mind but the people listening are going to be able to tell who is making more sense rhetorical practice religious debate is a philosophical sand box for intellectual child a bit condescending i know and i m sorry but hear me out it s a reasonable easy argument to get into that a lot of people care about for some reason it s an easy topic to get practice forming argument and inventingborrowing rhetoric and learning what people actually find convincing the question of god existence can lead into other more interesting or useful question what is the nature of knowledge how much of everything we call knowledge is justified and how much is faith what doe it mean to have justified knowledge and so on these sort of question can lead someone to sharpen their thinking about all kind of thing which might have nothing to do with god and religion

AH you made some good point but obviously have a political agenda here and are obviously a radical feminist this post wa not geared towards people like yourself i never said that a a husband i will grant permission for my wife to make money that is absurd look there are a lot of youtube channel and meme out there that make fun of radical feminism and although i do believe in equality for all the way feminist like you are trying to change the world is doing feminism more harm than good look i agree with feminsm however like most people i do not agree with radical feminism do nt fit the stereotype of a radical feminsit a a feminist you should want a many ally a possible however calling people sexist when they are clearly not is not going to help you it is making people against you all the claim you are making about me are not true i just wanted an intelligent debate on my post i wrote it is not supposed to be political and do nt take it personally this is change my view after all meaning i have good intention why am i typing this to you because the modern day feminist approach is not working and it is making feminism more disliked change your strategy you should want a many men to help you in your cause not turn them against you calling someone a sexist when they are trying to get their view changed is not going to help your cause remember that do nt be radical because radicalism never work
NONE well personally i agree with you the way you re currently thinking likely suggests there is no point for you to do this but it may not apply to everyone and may vary from person to person it s probably not worth doing but it depends on why you do it for example some people would just condemn her to be a dick or make themselves feel high and mighty calling her a basic bitch or something but others might condemn her in a more constructive way so she doe nt have to post picture for self validation so she understands why she doe what she doe and now ha the tool to change if she feel so inclined making an attempt to change her view in a sense both are condemning her the former is likely what we see more often but the latter doe exist and if you believe you can make a difference by doing the latter and you think it s worth it it can be rewarding and is nt entirely unproductive but what s important to remember is that both form provide something to the person doing the condemning is there anything in it for you perhaps not but it might be what others need in the same sense that posting picture is what this hypothetical girl need the girl post picture because she need to the condemner condemns her because they need to do we need to condemn the condemners i think not i think we can stop this cycle of condemnation right there
AH haha you re so full of shit tip for the future normal human do nt digress from a point they re making for a full paragraph to describe their physical characteristic and hobby when it ha nothing whatsoever to do with the topic at hand
NONE try thinking of it a more of a sliding scale rather than a binary thing you re at one end of the same spectrum but you could be closer to them than they are to normal you share an experience of being nonnormative for similar reason

NONE it is my impression that historical battlefield and memorial are funded by taxpayer so i do nt see why these statue being moved from official government site or public space would relegate them to falling apart not to mention that if people ca nt even raise enough money through donation to preserve a statue doe that statue have the popular support to remain anywhere in pubilc it certainly should nt use taxpayer money to preserve something that a most people find to at least whitewash if not glorify traitor to our country and b is used by extremist group to stir up unrest in regard to your second point do the british not consider our revolutionary hero to be traitor i would argue that they absolutely were viewed a traitor to king george i m genuinely curious what word you would use to describe people to unlawfully left our country declared war upon it and then killed hundred of thousand of our countryman before being forced to stop killing u they were traitor to our country to our constitution and to the people who had to fight and die to put down their rebellion traitor is the perfect word to describe the leader of the south additionally history is written by the victor ignores that the south spent the better part of a century rewriting their own history to be far more noble in their struggle than they truly were and that trope is pretty much ground zero of rbadhistory even today you still find a good chunk of american repeating blatant southern lost cause nonsense

NONE i generally agree with your post however i think the method could be better in order for you to perform the block you need the help of another driver who is also going the speed limit so instead of waiting to change lane until you spy a speeding car i think you should just always drive in the second lane since you do nt want anyone to pas anyways that way you reduce the risk of an accident while still performing the block

NONE therefore my point is that it would seem to me the sign of an evolved specie is one that life conscious of it s connection to each other and of their action so a not to bring suffering to others wrong because we do nt identify with our ego it is fair that others do nt identify with their ego therefore it is completely okay to have them suffer http enwikipediaorgwikiworkerbee you are right that suffering would not exist though it would cease to be an humanhuman concept

AH this is embarrassing people on reddit literally can not admit when they are wrong and therefore refuse to learn anything another waste of my time it s in the citation numbskull something you learn how to read in a place called college where people learn in woman and nearly in men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime defined a penetrating a victim by use of force or through alcoholdrug facilitation page nine http wwwcdcgovviolencepreventionpdfsvsurveillancedefinitionslapdf little buddy your ignorance is dangerous to woman god only know what else you believe
NONE the difference is in assumption of responsibility not in net effect there s a difference to you and to society between letting someone die and killing someone in both case a life is lost but in the former you are not or much le responsible it s a similar situation here you can let people die with only the blame of inaction on yourself or you can kill person now with the blame of murder on yourself mathematically you are correct that if your goal wa to perserve a much life a possible you would kill person and save however once you extrapolate that philosophy and attempt to apply it to solve the world s problem you could be actively committing terrible thing in the name of the greater good

NONE i realize that there are nt really good term for this but it s important to make a distinction between panhandler and the very poor plenty of people who are homeless are trying to make a better life for themselves and their family they are embarrassed to ask for money they respect those around them and you do nt really see them around the need help and they are grateful when they receive it then there are the aggressive panhandler that piss on doorway follow you down the street asking for money and shout obscenity at in the morning i do nt blame you for disliking this type of person but i think it s important to make the distinction and keep in mind that the majority of homeless people do nt fit the description you are annoyed by

NONE you re right protecting america is definitely a worthy goal let s think about the flip side for a second the problem is nt that people are worried about whether or not america is nt protected enough it s about the potential for consequence think of it this way let s say your government can secretly record you and your conversation it s a great way to protect the people right well sure what s the downside well what happens when the government start making new standard about what protecting mean doe protecting now mean hauling off people to jail who criticize the president how about being of a different party than the current party in power both of these could be viewed a destabilizing government if you give someone power to protect you then they can use that power in other way you see story about dirty cop all the time not suggesting most cop are that way however there is a danger in an authority figure retaining power because then they can decide they want to use it differently than we want them to the people that are uncomfortable with what the u is doing are worried about protecting themselves they want to be protected from their own government a much a any outside threat

NONE the short answer be selective about who you talk with about controversial topic some of your closer friend are probably already aware that you do nt share their political view so choose the one among them who you think you could have a conversation with and roll with it if you re sure you do want to discus it it s a good idea to lay the groundwork and then talk about it in person i ve seen many facebook conversation that get very heated and completely unreasonable when controversial topic are discussed discussing it in person get idea across very well because tone and body language can be used to guide the direction of the conversation which is often impossible on facebook

NONE yes they would it doe nt matter if they used to own that land the people that own it now are a sovereign state and do nt want them there in the same vein i do nt believe that the nation of israel should exist because i do nt believe they have a claim to the land just because they used to live there that s like me going into the house i grew up in and declaring to the current owner that i wa moving back in
AH do nt highroad me you dumb shit there is nothing there that indicates my stance on trans people before i m presented with evidence you do nt get to put word in my mouth i am saying that i will be giving them the benefit of the doubt and treating them the way i would treat anyone with respect and fairness in my response to the only other comment responding to me i also said that this is nt the only determining factor in my interpretation of the person s validity
NONE i agree with your sentiment entirely and wish this issue wa nt so often misunderstood or tackled with the best intention and the worst approach my thought is perhaps a better way to say this is anything le than equality is inequality which is easy to understand that giving special treatment to anyone for any reason is nt equality it s inequality i could be wrong and maybe there are far better way to phrase this i d love to hear your thought on the subject
AH well thankfully you do nt get to decide what s the norm move somewhere where woman do nt get the right we have here since you like that more your view work for you and not for the majority of society so hopefully you are nt too selfish to acknowledge that your view are depressing and very backwards maybe consider that a another reason men show no interest in you since you stated that a a concern of yours in your comment here
NONE you also ca nt memorize what to do for the presidency but you will need to respond swiftly and competently to those issue so if you get flustered talking about random topic that are related to being president i do not want to vote for you a president it s also one of the last place where money and advisor can not be sure those thing are wildly helpful to debate prep but at the end of the day it s just the candidate and that s a good thing

NONE so you agree that thing do nt get discovered and posted just because they re good what no you re missing my point there is a difference between posting a blog and spamming it there is a difference between no blog and no blogspam you can put your stuff out there but after or so posting if people are nt still reading your stuff it s for a reason and because of the nature of blog where anyone with a keyboard can make a page you re ruining your community if you just let them go wild if someone is a part of the communitysubreddit let say rhockey and they post there a lot and they post their blog there from time to time that is a member of the community saying hey everybody look at this article but if someone is nt an active member of rhockey and just post a link there with their blog every so often that guy is just saying go to my site

NONE i ve been paying attention to this myself i think this is a measure to correct the impression prevalent for a long time that men are more capable in cabinet position the reason that used to be given were because they were better under pressure and other sort of sexist nonsense ask yourself why doe it feel like so divisive one part is because it s completely upsetting the status quo the member of the new cabinet are quite capable and with the support of the civil service they ll do just a well a anyone else plus trudeau ha woman to choose from he s spoilt for choice of course only time will tell whether all the new mp men woman will do well so we ll see how it go

AH the aspect of it that s unattractive to me is nt the male part i would nt be comfortable dating a trans male either i think the thing for me is the implication of there being another version of this person that i am not allowed to see that is the single stupidest fucking thing i ve heard yet and ive heard all kind of excuse in the past ffs trans people feel little more than trauma regarding their past a great deal of the time if you are so entitled and selfish that you are put off about not being allowed to personally witness a part of someone s story that is traumatic to them and brings them immense pain than you have bigger character flaw than either homophobia or transphobia yikes i feel sorry for anyone who end up dating you and happens to bring a little baggage into the relationship
NONE you ll be much better off letting it happen naturally with someone you care about and love trying to force the issue and then possibly not enjoying it is going to make it that you wo nt want to do it again which can potentially steer you away from a meaningful relationship there is nothing wrong with being a virgin some people like to have sex a lot of it every chance they get and it doe nt matter too much with who and that s fine some people have sex with their significant other because it is another way to express love the more physical part of it and this is fine a well just let it be one day you ll find a good man or woman and will naturally have the desire to explore the physical part of the relationship anyone who pressure you because you re a virgin is a moron or immature the older you get and associate with older people the le people will be like that towards you

NONE people like you challenge him about why he doe nt like her so inevitably he will hone his opinion and get more and more data to give to you he made good point and even gave evidence from her biography i feel that he answered your question a well a anybody could and you just compare his argument to hating hitler sorry but you are not being constructive
AH that s an appeal to authority with the added benefit of not having to justify the clearly unjustifiable i m pretty sure you re trolling though so well done you got me
NONE i absolutely agree with your last statement do you think that ideally the guide would be equally a accessible for boy that s what i personally would argue not for a different version of the organization that is boy only

NONE let s not start with the ad hominims now you said so if you re straight and get blackout drunk and a guy fuck you in the as you will wake up and go hmmm guess that wa consensual which implies that you think blackout drunk mean nonconsent but now you say so then confirm with enthusiastic verbal consent the only way these two statement are compatible is if you assume that one can not appear to give enthusiastic consent when blackout drunk do you agree with this the problem is that this is not compatible with anyone s experience blackout drunk people can very much give enthusiastic consent many time you can not even tell they are blackout drunk and so we re back to every sexual encounter at least that involves alcohol at all is potentially rape regardless of how much effort you put in to ensure it is not do you support this position

NONE just because the country is able to get away with stuff merely implies that there is no effective higher controlling authority and doe not mean that the u is controlling the world the u is like the brat bully kid in school who ha a rich and connected father so he can get away with shit while the u military is expensive huge and powerful it can not even effectively control two impoverished armiless country iraq and afghanistan let alone the world there are a huge number of country that the u would have a tough time against in a war just look at vietnam the u could not do anything when russia expanded into crimea they were told not to butt their nose into the kashmir issue by india a well a pakistan there are hundred of example where country even close ally are doing opposite to what the u recommends tldr the u can not even control cuba you are severly overestimating the influence of u just travel outside the country and see how little influence america ha on their day to day life

AH even better op is nt commenting such a fucking waste
NONE very well put could nt have said it better in any way
AH oh that s rich i m the troll and i want woman to be raped no those who commit crime should be punished however i m not going to condemn someone for a crime they have not yet committed saying that that must mean i want woman raped make no more sense than if i said you must want people murdered unless you support running around arresting people because there s some portion of useu citizen who murder people
NONE i do nt think every murderer is a threat to guard and other inmate but some people are there are people who committed multiple murderer while already in jail i am talking about death penalty for those not garden variety onetime murderer if you have a person who killed other people while in jail i would say it is unconscionable to let him live and murder again
AH imagine a voter of average intelligence and then realize that half of the population is worse that depends on your definition of average bigoted selfish ignorant swampdonkey pretty bigoted insult ironically you really have no understanding of the depravity of ignorance at that level careful if you tip your fedora too hard you might hurt yourself the best argument against democracy is a fiveminute conversation with the average voter and your alternative is
NONE would nt you say then that their gnosticness is delusional it s no longer a question of knowledge but of overwhelming belief that overshadows rational query would nt a more apt classification be a rational theist v an irrational theist maybe but a a general rule calling people irrational and delusional when debating them is a counterproductive tactic if your goal is to change their viewthe view of people who follow them further it s somewhat irrelevant to the question of whether or not it s a useless term
AH i m just going to stop because it s clear you are a nazi sympathizer or a nazi yourself talking to you is disconcerting
NONE technically you re right it s once you give a specific race a disadvantage or discriminate against them that racism occurred
AH the medium present it like that because it s true for the majority of people your case is rare you ca nt use your anecdotal experience with a drug to justify banning it for everyone your view ha no logical or statistical backing find some real evidence because this view is worthless
NONE the problem is that a a general rule we all consider ourselves good judge of character even when there s no real basis for that belief it s intuitively satisfying to believe that you can know what a small isolated mistake tell you about a person but that doe nt mean that it s true
AH the eu is nt a nation it is nt even close to being a nation get over it
NONE it s a free country you are allowed to be offended by somebody s tshirt
AH your view is ignorant unempathetic and small you talk of sympathy for crime like there is a sliding scale on the general acceptance of crime it not that simple also your use of legal in the first definition of your original post show your true fucking colour punk you use semantics to prove your own innocence in the matter to the loosest definition of the word legally you are nt an as
NONE for the record i do nt agree with you i think the survey expressly reject the conclusion of your thesis and that it s abhorrent to limit something a fundamental a personal agency and bodily autonomy on the off chance that it might result in some net gain of happiness a defined by a handful of people in fancy hat but if i did change your view in some way i guess that s technically something
AH poor kid do nt have the same opportunity that rich kid do rich kid have access to tutor better school and teacher do nt have to work during high school and are nt discriminated against by the education system and if you believe that anybody should have to work hour a week you are no better than a slavery apologist
NONE exactly there is no rule or anything good parent a good people should have support from their own family not because they have to but because they want to of course life happens and child grow up to have their own life but it s not immoral for parent to expect or at least hope for some support from their own child
AH no you are mixing two thing we did not evolve to rape that kind of statement just make you look foolish
NONE i agree that they are a necessary evil in many way that s pretty different from essentially a good thing for human however
AH if you say that something will be replaced then you do have to specify what you will be replacing it with i actually dont and your saying so is an example of a beautiful fallacy betraying your insecurity but it just so happens that it ha been known for quite some time what happens after capitalism http wwwredditcomrbasicincomewikiindex i ca nt help it if you re uneducated but marx ha been on shelf in the literate world since the s and the postcapitalism world is very thoroughly understood via both experiment and model if you are paying attention you ll note that i never said china should never have adopted capitalism and neither did i say they were nt better off today than they used to be that s your very own little strawman among many in your post are you afraid of something right there so while you re jumping to conclusion in your haste to defend your childhood s worldview you might to look before you leap this time but by the way there is nt a region on the planet which ha not been better off a hundred year after any particular point in time you care to choose that s because science and technology progress it ha nothing to do with capitalism enjoy your report and block kiddo
NONE while i sympathize a tiny bit with your viewpoint a appalling a that sound i think you re missing a huge point about this which is that we ca nt be trusted with this power if society get to decide who is a drain on society and kill them there s no logical end to this where on the autism spectrum doe someone have to be before you can kill them how do you prove it and you know how society will use this power because we ve seen it before i hate going all godwin on you but hitler thought that jew were a drain on society or at least drummed up enough support pandering to people that wanted a scapegoat this is nt some weird ancient thing that human have managed to get over it happened multiple time well within the last century no one should have this power because this power will not may be will eventually be abused it doe nt matter if in the case you want it actually would be a good idea and it s not an abstract slipperyslope argument either we have a large history of idea like this resulting in atrocity and in the killing of people that others just did nt like salem witch trial anyone communist dictatorship after all the capitalist are a burden on our economy anyone that try to own the mean of production clearly need to be killed

AH retard it ca nt be a secret demolition without you know killing all the passenger whose family lost them you suggest that those plane with those family did nt die well trust me they sure a hell did a hologram you think the government ha the ability to project hologram up and fly them around in time with the crashing of plane people do nt know what a plane exploding sound like when it crash they hear an explosion and say that i watched the plane come in and smack the tower and turn into a fireball
NONE i think what i fear the most about it is that it s completely out of my control i ca nt control what go through the shooter head it s more in your control than being hit by a drunk driver is for example most of the time when people get shot it s because the shooter is targeting them specifically if you do nt join a gang or do something horrible to someone you can dramatically lower your risk of being shot you ca nt do much to avoid drunk driver on the other hand other than staying off the road at certain time
AH his action speak for themselves a do those that condone them if you disagree that is your prerogative but have the intellectual honesty to admit your misogyny you are not fooling anyone
NONE i do nt believe i ever argued that they were your premise is that these profession do more good than soldier and i m asking why you do nt want to extend the benefit to other critical pillar of our society
AH i m actually the guy this guy quoted above about going through his post history and i just did it again because i responded to this guy in depth day ago via pm after he wa banned ironic that he s saying these thing because he never responded to my long indepth pm he claim my argument do nt stand up to scrutiny but when i take the time to respond to each of his question he just doe nt respond and leaf it be clearly there is nt a problem of people he is talking to have their point stand up to scrutiny the problem is that when he get an answer he ignores it and move on the reason we check post history is bc reddit ha cancerous alt right brigadier festering in td and we do nt give nazi a platform to troll or spread their hateful ideology keep living life with the blinder on i should also add this guy said there wa nothing wrong with the mass genocide of native american
NONE let me start by asking if he so dumb how come he won the election he s a demagogue who just tell people what they want to hear is the usual responce just like every other politician ever if you want to see trump what he look like when he s not shit posting on twitter or doing controversial thing to distract the press look up his statement on the remodeling of the un building it s undeniable he ha to be atleast a little bit smarter than you think he is they ve been saying he make mistake all the time see nervous man say this is the end for donald trump for the seventh time this year by the huffington post they have nt been right yet the typo in tweet got the msm to cover every terrorist attack in the last year right after his travel ban or other typo got the medium to talk about aggression in the south china sea maybe it s just you and maybe i m wrong but it would be pretty hard for anyone to get where he is with out having atleast some idea about what he s doing
AH although i can i wo nt debate this comment because you are being nothing but toxic all over this post
NONE this is so far the most reasonable and wellinformed comment i ve seen on this thread i hope it get voted higher
AH you have no clue what you are talking about
NONE then how would they get what fifa is about
AH you are not a true nerd in fact you sound autistic
NONE just do nt move to hawaii you d be in a permanent rage
AH sound like you re a bit backwards buddy i did nt ask for your personal opinion of me via a post i m challenging your view what you re launching into is an ad hominem attack so you do nt have to think like you do with race which is why you re dumb enough to be arrogant i do nt know where you re from but where i m from idle threat from stranger can get you in a lot more trouble then bad habit it wa nt a threat try and see how your behavior and harebrained thinking can get you into trouble like maybe tolerating a bitch racist and marrying her and telling the best person you ve ever known to fuck off because they re brown but you re too dun smart for all that
NONE you can just move past them a a guy i get how hard it can be not getting reply online someone who ca nt relate to how that make you feel could easily say you can just move past rejection but that doe nt make it suck le message from horny dude can go way further than a risque message or dickpic how would you feel if a man sent you an opening message detailing the graphic sexual thing they wanted to do to you or that they wanted to rape you because you re just so good looking imagine getting that on a regular basis i ve gotten ton of screenshots from friend who are girl that were frankly horrifying and it wa the guy s first message
AH please kiddo go try walking in minnesota in the dead of winter just let u know where to pick up your corpse
NONE if you re not willing to shoot the cat next time it enters your property than you have no right to a catfree yard
AH embarrassing you do nt even understand the concept of sentience i ll make sure to save the drowning chicken instead of you should the situation arise then

AH other hobby include getting torched with your buddy and trolling reddit
NONE remembers what subreddit we re in and resists trolling with all xi might
AH you are a weird kind of snobby
NONE something like this is a good idea
AH delta exist yes there s a fancy little link right there and you know what you can do you can click on it and you know what will happen lol it s crazy but you can actually see the point i have conceded and if you simply read up just a tiny bit you would realize all of your point have been addressed like i said if you want to make an accusation if you do nt want to look like a fool when you do it get up to speed you re free to do so without getting up to speed if you wish but do nt expect me to take what you re saying at all seriously
NONE it s likely illegal more importantly it s wrong you want to have kid but you taking that course of action demonstrates you were nt ready for them and would justify her decision it also wo nt help you re pissed understandably but if you start getting into this and take morally bankrupt action to get back at her you re not going to get over it you ll just start hating yourself the only way to get over her is focus on doing that and when you find someone else and do have kid they wo nt have to see you in said porn or know you released it
AH can you stop saying bullshit propaganda like no study exists saying circumcision harm sensitivity http onlinelibrarywileycomdoijxxabstract http wwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed http wwwtheweeklingscomwpcontentuploadssorrellschartcopyjpg of course i bet you will just continue to shut your brain off and pretend like these link and many others just do nt exist you honestly make me sick
NONE damn you literally just made up a bogus analogy and then accused me of making a statement there are different type of experiment http enwikipediaorgwikiexperiment edit i feel like you re saying we ca nt do an experiment to see if aspirin help headache because people can just get aspirin on their own outside of the study well yeah they can and it might happen but that s why we look at large number and we do nt take result a irrefutable truth
AH i do nt know what grokking is but you re being oversensitive if men are the problem dismissing a male voice solely because it is male is a sure fire way to set up the kind of echo chamber in which considering a greeting a indistinguishable from harassment seems like a good idea saying hello in the context of passing a stranger on the street is not harassment at all it s someone trying to be friendly if you re offended by the most cursory of human interaction maybe the problem is nt the person saying hello it s the person who s offended
NONE from the perspective of the teller no offense is seen a helpful advice from the perspective of the receiver no offense is seen a a nosey annoying statement a a minority the introphrase is often used to say something highly ignorantracistor offensive you might have good intention but for the most time people use the saying to attempt to get away with something that is indeed offensive or it is not received well because they did nt want to hear what you are saying at the time
AH this is not the first comment where i see how outraged you are we are making a conversation here not an argument i never said that an ideology based in killing all race except one would evolve to a better system i quote if we eliminate the racist and homophobic idea so i m against eliminating others i m starting to think that you are part of sjw or other tumblr shitty extremist group who ca nt function normally in a society stop putting word in my mouth
NONE i do nt disagree at all with your view i guess i m a bigot too for speaking truth and any black that see this and agree will be labeled uncle tom in the process they have a name for this called the model minority myth but this naming convention itself wa designed to dispell the so called myth so that it would be automatically dismissed instead of used a a real argument you should nt feel bad about reality and thing you ca nt personally change kudos to you for being a minority in this country and making a better life for yourself something that i think everyone can respect sure there will be jealous hater but f em
AH ok well if someday by chance you get lung cancer and end up in this position but ca nt ask to be relieved your family will probably not murder you and have you suffer so that their puny brain doe nt have to deal with difficult situation let s leave that to the government folk they know better you remember this reddit thread and then you will understand i have nothing further to contribute
NONE no you re trying to put word in my mouth again dependence need to be eliminated not the dependent that s why you raise child give dog to the blind and wheelchair to paralyzed people to eliminate dependence a much a possible because it s never positive whether embryo are child is another story but i do nt think we ll ever agree on that
AH lol baseless ad hominem the last refugee of failure in an argument you are stuck on creep shot meaning upskirts or changing room or something which we are specifically not talking about here go away now
NONE fair enough but third party ca nt be allowed to get away with using human shield either or the same moral hazard exists if there s a genocide involved here you d have to lay it at the foot of the god program
AH i will refer you to this comment http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsocmvpoliceofficersdonttargetminoritydhcsv context and suggest that you partake in that experiment
NONE what evidence do you have that thing used to be better because i see http enwikipediaorgwikiwalterduranty lot of evidence http enwikipediaorgwikiyellowjournalism that they were nt
AH reason it s illegal in quite a few state to travel in the far left lane when not passing so you may be breaking the law reason the left lane is designated by nearly every state s rule of the road and by nearly every driving manual that exists a the passing lane not the fast lane reason it is illegal in many state to pas on the right you are forcing somebody to do something illegal while also breaking the law yourself it is not your job to enforce speed limit if it creates a dangerous situation like that and i have seen police give out ticket for just this reason leave law enforcement to law enforcement official reason why should i have to move out of your way just because you ca nt be bothered to move the steering wheel slightly to the left or right why is it their duty to be courteous to you the law and common driving courtesy is on their side it seems you are the one being an entitled discourteous driver here
NONE i ll address your point one at a time this sound like an argument for more or wider bike lane cyclist have a legal right to use the road and it is nt their fault if the condition of the infrastructure make it impossible to allow car to pas them most state have law that cyclist must stay a close to the side of the road a safely possible if a cyclist is riding in the middle of the lane blocking traffic when they could move over they are breaking the law is nt this a much greater concern for the cyclist obviously no one want to be involved in an accident but the rider is risking severe injury or death if they are struck whereas the driver is almost never hurt a an aside if they are inch away from you then you are breaking the law in many state http bikeleagueorgcontentstatebikelaws again how is this selfish on the part of the cyclist they are the one taking the risk no one like to be stuck in traffic but the solution is nt to put limit on who can access public road it s to improve the road
AH have you thought about homeschooling if not then you need to follow the rule champ
NONE i agree right down to the election you mention the is how do we abolish it
AH bullshit you know exactly why it matter and it s why you started your post with it and it s why it s your username you claiming to not understand why it matter is the biggest tell ever that you re completely full of shit
NONE astrology is bullshit and the only way to convince the op that it s not bullshit would be to feed him bullshit it s circular logic although it would change op s view if he believed it i do nt think it s the intent of this subreddit to convince people by lying to them
AH your point of view is trash sorry i did nt want to tell you it s racist and it s privileged and i do nt really give a fuck if you imagine yourself to understand what it s like to be black every person experience is unique yours is nt more important or valid than the experience of those who identify more easily with people who look more like them you did nt get where you are on your own others pioneered those path you should try giving them credit sometime you re an obnoxious snotty brat high school kid who doe nt know what real life is like and you probably grew up in a privileged suburb far away from black community judging by your bourgeois attitude also you re not in stem so stop lying that s all do nt reply your narrowmindedness and assumption that everyone must be like you and your brand new friend disgust me just thought i d let you know also your argument is a trash straw man so your logic is shit it s literally the noobest mistake there is you re not smart you re not strong and you only think you are lucky get a new attitude or the rest of your life will consist of you never knowing what it mean to feel good about yourself feeling superior is nt the same a feeling good btw that s what you re missing you re welcome ciao bella
NONE immersion is important to you and me it s not important to everyone i think it s okay for you to ask but it s unreasonable for you to expect people to keep quiet in a shared space it would be nice if they d do it for you but it s not a requirement they re not being rude if they re behaving in the shared space the way the majority of people there typically behave watching tv without wanting to hear people talk about irrelevant stuff is not unreasonable that s just a statement about your value you value the tv episode you do not value the talk which to you is irrelevant it s relevant to the people who are doing the talking if you need quiet you should find a private place to get it the majority of people talk during tv show you can spend your life railing against it which wo nt change anything or you can accept that i understand that you enjoy having other people watch the show with you you will have to choose between that and the quiet you want you probably ca nt have both unless you one day live with people who share your value and habit in the end it doe nt matter whether we agree with you that it s rude or not i do nt think your family is rude but let s say you convince me and others here that they are how will that change anything after we label the behavior a rude your family will continue talking and you ll continue wishing they would nt they re behaving the way human typically behave in most culture people in a shared space talk to each other when i am watching a show what i care most about is immersion so i sympathize but immersion is not what most people care most about not when they re watching a a group
AH well are nt you combative today you re trying to reach a level of empiricism that ca nt exist in the social science and it seems to even in the science the best we can do in the social science is say this subjectively happens a lot so we ll call it objective
NONE the thing about s culture though is that you mostly choose to be a part of one you could argue that you are born into many culture but you can always move or join another social group i can judge people for joining a social group that i disagree with
AH look i m not here to say that everything is perfect but i m saying there are reason that affirmative action is justified there are group and race who benefit from affirmative action and it is good for society even if your racist view are right and people who d grade are undeserving get into college it can still be justified by other goal woman and military veteran also get affirmative action and there are good reason to support that and black and hispanic people are from community that need help and that is worth supporting so you are an admitted rich kid and you are pissed because you think this may have hurt you ok well boooo hoooo i do nt care even if you are right i do nt care because other group need more help than you do and that is why it si justified
NONE all right so if you d be okay with having some male hour and some female hour what do you think of the reasoning in my last paragraph woman have expressed interest and so they have been given hour however if men do nt express interest i do nt think they need to just do it anyway for the sake of it because if no one s interested no one would be benefited while others would be disadvantaged there are different type of equality and one is equality of opportunity so i would argue that if their policy is that if men or woman ask for segregated time they ll give it to them then that is the kind of equality that matter the fact that men do nt have these kind of priority and dont ask for it doe nt make the gym sexist a long a they would be willing to do it if the demand arose
AH oh yea how much do you spend on labor what percentage of your expense go to it raise price fuck off unless you run a landscaping business or some other business where your only expense is labor you re fucking dreaming not to mention if every schmuck got paid dollar an hour you d probably manage to find some more business in the place you draw your worker from
NONE the most important sort of money is fuck you money i know people on modest wage who have it i know people who make six figure who do not fuck you money is simple it mean you do not depend on anyone else for money and if you were to quite your job tomorrow you could survive for long enough to get a new job rather than be on the street tomorrow
AH meaning if you re evacuating at all you have minimum hour to move most likely more than hour i do nt know where this particular pizza hut is but hour is likely enough time to move if you have an evacuation plan evacuating hour before a hurricane make landfall is not enough time read other comment from people in the thread regarding why hour is for people who choose not to evacuate for whatever reason so these people are not going anywhere they re staying and hurricane is pretty acute weather event it s either on you or not so h before hurricane is normal weather normal day okay now i realize i m arguing with an idiot a major hurricane making landfall is not a normal weather normal day situation now this might be surprising to you if your knowledge of hurricane is purely from sensationalist medium it s not i will bet you my next paycheck that my knowledge of them far outshines yours it can be devastating but it s also common place and usually no big deal this is a blatant contradiction devastating no big deal wow til
NONE i think many people are finding it difficult to follow you you might want to try rphilosophy or giving more example about your view i assume that in this world anything can happen that s a big assumption not everything can happen there are actual physical limitation even thing that are possible are often very unlikely to happen so in choosing between investing one s time in creating a potentially revolutionary social and technological movement vs earning several million of dollar which will take year could happen is not the same a will happen the question is what doe potentially mean if there is chance i ll develop something fantastic then yes it s worth my time if the chance of succeeding are then no it s not worth it and i d do myself and society a favor if i worked a normal job think of it this way it is physically possible for me to marry natalie portman but the chance of that happening are almost nonexistent she s already married and is probably not interested in random creepy internet fan spending my time to chase after her is a waste of everyone s time and resource
AH i wa unsatisfied with his argument of course you were if nobody cared about my brother and somehow he had the mental capacity of a pig it would be merciful to end his life you think killing and eating people is permissible if they are dumb loner the alien argument doe nt hold water either a it is never addressed whether the alien is significantly more intelligent than human assuming they are is it morally permissible for them to treat you that way largely it is ok to kill animal for food because they provide important resource to u and because they are not very smart we do nt need to kill them for resource there are human that are a smart a these animal that would be wrong to kill so lesser intelligence is not a good enough reason to kill unnecessarily
NONE your point wa that sociopathy could lead to more harm my stance on that issue is that the harm done to animal by the meat industry is provably more harmful would you then accept the argument that the efficiency required of the meat industry force people harming animal for nutritional reason to behave in a way that doe nt favor not harming the animal but being cost effective lead to more harm than sociopath ever could cause the issue is that intent doe nt matter to anyone but one person the intender your example did not show that intent matter it showed how intent could possibly lead to more torture and this is bad however it is only bad because of the concept of more harm it would nt make sense to say that it is ok to kill animal for meat a long a you harm them relatively le even still we know this is nt the case
AH you seem to have trouble tracking your own word from prior comment disassociation like that can be a sign of alzheimer s consider getting that checked

AH except the unquestionably well recorded long history handed down generation to generation that any sociologist worth their salt would argue is absolutely real evidence that you ca nt find record of an atrocity buried in the dust of a ruined empire s official whitewashed record is hardly a leg to stand on and just for the record using a lack of evidence a evidence when jewish people have a holiday literally thousand of year old proof to the contrary seems particularly doltish even for reddit i might remind you that many scholar believe jesus s last supper wa a passover seder http wwwbiblicalarchaeologyorgdailypeopleculturesinthebiblejesushistoricaljesuswasjesuslastsupperaseder but no matter let forget egypt and instead use the whole rest of jewish history from the end of the roman empire through the dark age crusade until today my point still stand satisfied
NONE but would nt the timeline be wrong especially since it mention people adam who according to you only existed to make the creation story more understandable to scientific illiterate people or are you saying that adam didnt really begat seth but rather some of the later people existed during an actual point in history where a timeline would be usefulaccurate like it purposefully skipped hundred of generation or something or do you think adam did exist but wa nt the first man or wa god pretending adam existed to remain consistent with his purposefully inaccurate portrayal of creation which he made to the aid of people two thousand year ago and to the detriment of the million of people in modern time who either still believe it or do nt believe in christianity because of it none of this make any sense to me
AH i understand that it may be hard for you to understand what i m saying it s alright but next time you try to argue with someone learn how to comprehend english

AH men in that context doe not refer to men specifically but all humanity again stop trying to turn everything into a fucking gender issue i ca nt tell if you think everything is a gender issue because you guy have bad reading comprehension or if you have bad reading comprehension because you want everything to be a gender issue which one is it
NONE well if they do nt care about gender that make pansexuality their real sexuality yeah what it doe is make gender a useless qualifier for what they find attractive i get that it seems normal that everyone must have a preference for a gender or gender but if you do nt and something else entirely is important to you why not have some way of describing what that is
AH leading by example i see

NONE this is it could nt have said it any better
AH refusing to interact with someone because they choose to utilize particular offensive language is nt censorship even crass asshole do nt like pedantry doe nt the level of activity on a given sub serve that purpose exactly earlier in the thread you asked why is it so terrible to request that someone use a different word the answer is because it piss people off and reduces the activity so if a the op point out you do nt want to isolationist and limit your influence then you will not be hyper sensitive about language otherwise you are just being retarded
NONE i see a distinction between deliberately using dialect ai nt yall which the spellchecker will recognize and correct if you let it and not paying enough attention to a message to correct the error that the spellchecker let slip by like to too two or there their or you re your my question is it negligenceapathy in the editing process or is it ignorance ie not actually not knowing the difference specific deliberate example ie v ie the spellchecker tell me that it should be capitalized but i do nt care or disagree so there is a distinction between choicedecision and ignoranceapathy
AH if you had any experience you would understand and not come across a a year old who ha just discovered google i could tell you about the hundred of difference in germany where regulation betriebsrat and culture which protect family and worker at the expense of business i could tell you all about the safety net which are paid for by tax to ensure social service are available for everyone i could tell you about pedestrian will should at you if you cross the road when the walking light is red even when it is am and there is not a car in sight i could literally talk for hour about the experience i have seen and lived through which highlight what a safe but stale life it is to be in germany and how much of the culture is about preserving this life rather than improving it but at the end of the day you are just a knowitall teenager who think a few google search can replace actually experiencing it so i will just concede everything you think about germany is correct and you found website which probably agree i will happily continue discussing my experience and the experience of others i ve talked to with other redditors but not with you a you already know everything
NONE i am not going to really say your wrong but i do nt think the time line will be a short a a lot of people expect since the industrial revolution really smart expert have claimed we were year from a society where one man could make everything and no one would have any job in the year since then we are still year away from that because a tech replaces job most of the displaced people find work in other field and yes there are tun of article claiming it is different this time but there were tun of article in the about how the it wa different then and then again the in and the when computer showed up every time everyone say this is the time we are all replaced by automation part of the problem is you are compairing human v machine and that is not relevant the question is doe human capital have any value a long a people are capable of providing value people will have job until you have an ai so grate a to make human unless you will still have human in the workforce even if it is just to pick up the thing the robot drop so i will admit that sure there will probably be a time when this happens but i do nt trust our ability to predict it until it actually happens
AH did you miss the part where i do nt really give a shit about this topic you have thousand of comment on this very same topic i suggest you read through them if you have the next hour of your life free
NONE this ha to be the most frequently stated view on this sub i feel like it should be banned at this point because if you want to see a different view you can just look at the dozen of other discussion of this exact same topic that are posted every couple day
AH well they are the militia so your question is pretty fucking stupid also your ignorance on automatic weapon and the legality of open carry collapse your whole argument you re simply a reactionary bigot
NONE you re completely correct on this one they are political propaganda show and when anyone try to call them out on their crap they fall back to their convenient we re just a silly comedy show defense
AH demanding disclosure is usually done in the form of asking i ve already said that if asked someone should be honest not disclosing is rape a far a me and many others are concerned and that belief make you a shitty person a far a me and many others are concerned i d think someone who wanted to have consensual sex would be eager to disclose to avoid harming their partner zero harm is done by not disclosing in and of itself even if i thought some were to elevate it to the level of rape is completely absurd what nonpredatory person would actually want to do this to their partner that person is nt trans that person is lying and is being intentionally deceptive a trans person is presenting themselves a they are
NONE if the burden is on the target of sexual activity they have an infinitely sized list of possible disclosure to make no they do nt the list of thing that people know full well would be dealbreakers for the vast majority of people eg being in a marriage being trans is pretty small most people likely would meet one or zero of those criterion if i m a crosscountry skier i m not obligated to tell people that before sex because i know that fact is not likely to make another person reconsider consenting to sex if they knew about it if i m married i am obligated because i know full well that it is likely to make another person reconsider consenting
AH if we were to have one person directly elected by the people the legitimacy of the other branch would dissipate congress would no longer be the body representative of the people that would now be the president you must be the first child resentful and unloved by your parent since the birth of your much cuter little sister no man it make both legitimate representative of the people one at a state level and the other a national scale the supreme court would represent the will of the past how could they legitimately stand up to a single individual who represents a mandate for the present the will of the past jesus you sound dramatic they stand up to the president via a lifetime appointment something that ha nt changed the check and balance that protect minority right and help ensure stability and institutional strength would collapse in the face of an individual tribune of the people we would no longer elect a president we would elect a king and the american government a we ve known it for century would be gone most likely forever which one and why are they collapsing again dude you have nt explained why anything you ve said will happen all you do is make baseless and hyperbolic assertion rebelling again anything that threatens the status quo like a panicked xenophobe you go on about a divide being the best argument but you do nt make that argument not everyone assumes it to be true just because that s what they were taught in statefunded education program
NONE i think a trump presidency would be a wakeup call for the u and show the average american that a functioning democracy requires citizen who engage with their government it would put america s bigotry and racism centerstage and force u to actually confront it rather than our medium s current babygloves approach on the contrary you would empower every delusional follower of trump and make them and the rest of the country believe that he actually represents the majority your vote is not a complex form of communication there is no s to denote sarcasm or any other way to make it clear to anyone why you voted for who you did the only result will be a yes for trump that s it if half the people who vote for him are doing so in protest it will look exactly a it would if all of them were rabid partisan and result like that have a way of changing political paradigm the consequence of him winning could be a sea change in american politics based not on a recognition of his ridiculousness but on the idea that people like him are valid winning candidate while i am seriously concerned about the kind of supreme court justice we would see trump nominate i m fairly confident that the congress would be able to weed out the extremist and temper the lasting effect of trump in the white house i m a conservative but i ll play devil s advocate you re banking a hell of a lot on republican losing the house and senate if that doe nt happen even a lot of the nevertrump crowd will approve his nominee
AH so is comparing rape with the topic at hand my post wa a comment not a point of argument go spend your mom and dad money you little shit

AH how doe an act that benefit men and doe not harm men make you uncomfortable and annoyed at feminist you re being intentionally obtuse and refusing to listen to the fact that it does nt erase male rape
NONE that might be one way to put it another would be that they do nt see meaningful sexism or racism and instead see joke and hijinks that are needed to loosen up a straightjacketed public discourse
AH but you did nt argue that they re alive dum dum you tried badly to make an argument form sentinence and showed off both your lack of logical reasoning skill and general lack of knowledge not my fault that you parade your shortcoming around on the internet
NONE your general argument seems to be that drug are bad for society and i agree however this doe nt justify making them illegal if the government made all our decision for u in a way that wa good for society they would nt be justified in taking away our freedom
AH check his post history this is not satire that said he s made a pretty good argument a to why woman should be wary about breastfeeding in public freak like him

NONE i agree but i m sure your getting some shitty message from many people who do nt right now many of the reaction remind me of the reporter and general public reaction in parks and recreation to any minor thing that go wrong calling for resignation and what not i think people just like to jump on a band wagon and get super angry over thing that have nt really effected them much at all mob mentality kind of thing i personally could nt give two shit but fuck it die pao die

AH i think it s hilarious that a person who ha been an economist for nearly year fails see that the cmv is about people using the analogy of the national budget a a household budget is the deal regardless of whether the deficit is a big deal fall on it s face when it s said that a house ca nt have a deficit that big because they d never get out of debt hurr hurr hurr a household budget ca nt print it own money a government can this is where the analogy of the us economy and a household budget are similarly structured fall apart but what do i know i have nt been an economist for nearly year i must just be dumb op is correct politician the right heavier than the left us this scare tactic to take advantage of people who do nt know much about economics however it appears that people who do know a lot about economics talking bout you champ do nt seem to know much either
NONE i think that sub accurately reflects the politics of most redditors and it s not a democratic party circlejerk it s much more of a liberal circlejerk people there honestly are nt that in favor of obama per se just opposed to obamabashing a though he were the source of all problem in the us government but that s just because reddit is mostly college student and a the saying go if you are nt a liberal when you re twenty you have no heart and if you are nt a conservative when you re you have no brain what the real problem is and it s a problem that is by no mean limited to rpolitics is that people do nt follow reddiquette they downvote post that they disagree with rather than one that are nt relevant to the group anything called rpolitics would end up exactly that way here it s a popular view the only option would be to have nothing named rpolitics
AH oh crap you re one of those you are an idiot i voted for jill stein wa that misogynistic shut up with that b talking point you got from the hillary campaign you just lost all credibility and this will be my last reply because you are obviously a child that s the kind of argument that lost you the election a far a the iraq timeline is concerned research what the democrat general wesley clark ha to say about it there are two viable party because they make it that way and they want you to blindly follow them without question well i wo nt do that they are free do screw u over time and time again by u blindly following them you can take that purity test stuff too and shove it you might be ok with dishonest politician but i m not i m not going to argue bernie s record it s pretty much the strongest resume out there you choose to let your bias dictate what you believe but i will say that by not letting so called outsider in and run a democrat you are basically putting the last nail in your coffin how do you expect to get new member if new member are nt allowed and obviously you have knowledge of the history of political party otherwise you would realize how stupid you sound and besides all that bernie ha caucused with the democrat since the early s he ha had democratic committee assignment and ha chaired several democratic committee maybe you do nt know what any of that mean i m not sure but i do know that the more you talk about politics the more apparent it becomes that you do nt really know the subject that well you can reply if you d like but i m not wasting anymore time on you you need to take a good look in the mirror and start talking about stuff that you know
NONE your view a i gleaned from the post title is that low information voter should be discouraged from voting it sound like what you re now arguing in your response to my post is that we should cease perpetuating the idea that people should vote because it is their patriotic duty i actually agree wholeheartedly with this but this is nt the view you originally stated what i m saying is that under almost no circumstance should anyone be discouraged from voting when granted the social opportunity to discourage a low information or ignorant voter from going out to the poll the option should be taken instead to increase their information or get rid of some of that ignorance basically if you find someone saying to you yeah i m gon na vote on election day but i do nt really know who to vote for just gon na choose the candidate with the coolest sounding name then the correct option is not to say hey you should nt vote what you should say is hey you should actually take the politifact quiz it ll tell you whose view are most aligned with your own so you have a better idea for who you should vote for only take minute if they are nt receptive then telling them how to find out who to vote for doe about a much good a telling them not to they ll just do their own thing anyway if they are receptive then asking them to take that quick quiz still doe much more good than discouraging them this is why i felt like you were saying two different thing because i agree that the general attitude that people vote for the sake of voting should be discouraged and people should nt go around telling other people that but i do nt think that an uneducated person who ha committed to voting even through societal pressure should be discouraged from doing so rather we should attempt to educate them
AH so you re a moron got it
NONE that s it i m outta here
AH you realize that the only real disagreement in islam is who the bos is right but ok back to your second paragraph you might be all pal with the klan irl like you claim but would you take to the internet to defend their presence i highly doubt it and a to your thought crime statement people are socially and even governmentally sanctioned for their belief system everyday america used to deal with communist very efficiently if i do nt want to bake a cake for a gay wedding holy shit i m a nazi and i must be crushed if i wo nt let woman into my cafe hey man it s their culture this is nt going to go anywhere you are clearly so dedicated to this meme that defending this savage backwards violent belief system is some noble progressive cause that you wo nt stop even while they are telling you in no uncertain term that your extinction is their goal i wish i could convey to you how absurd you look from an outside perspective so let me just end with this every time a truck run over child you are partly responsible every time a bomb go off and kill innocent you are partly responsible every time a wheelchair bound aid worker is gang raped and her rapist go free because she did nt fight hard enough you are partly to blame every time a bar or nightclub is shot up you are partly to blame you and your leftist ally brought this plague upon the civilized world and your vote and muslim apologist facebook shit condone it your attacking of those trying to fix the muslim problem exacerbate it you wo nt realize this to be true until it s too late
NONE i do nt even know how the item on your list is a liberal attribute if i went to a right wing pro gun website and went to the message board it would nt take me that long to find an anti mrap post or a the cop are too militarized post to claim that that viewpoint is liberal is a very selective view of those who hold any cop sentiment you can also take environmentalist off that list a well if something happens to society a lot of human will die and a lot more land will back to the animal this would be an extreme environmentalist s best case scenario more habitatcheck le animal cruelty perpetuated by human check so that one go wealth distribution you have argued against that one yourself if a guy with a gun can take what he want from a guy without a gun he just redistributed the wealth and what would money be able to do anyway if shipping system broke down what are you going to buy with your money backed by a government that doe nt exist anymore hmm what else is left intellectual snob like the guy who know how to build and maintain thing those guy the people who can keep a power plant running or how to maintain system that are still in place or your doctor or scientist or engineer yeah you still need those people in fact you need them probably more then you ever needed them before also you ca nt make broad generalization like you did and then blame people for nitpicking you on the word that you use i fail to see that you have any true understanding of shade of gray when you re entire introduction to your post separated people into a stark blackwhite dichotomy
AH if you have a problem with the competence of a coworker the professional thing to do is to make your concern known to their supervisor and let them handle it he got global news for this memo that is way more effective than some iq manager throwing the memo in the garbage publicly shaming or calling out the coworker is massively unprofessional it ha nothing to do with fee fee and everything to do with the smooth operation of the organization public shaming lol you are so delusional i am sure you actually have nt read the memo which logical argument are you referring to yup you have nt read the memo or maybe you do nt know what logic is are you insinuating that all manager are nt smart enough yes most manager are completely incompetent people generally the people who ca nt directly work with technology work with people they are the lower iq of the organization and are primarily spokesman for the higher ups nearly everything said on the topic of gender in that manifesto wa misleading at best and in general inaccurate let alone the implication that empathy and people skill are nt necessary or are detriment to software engineering is also false he wa correct that woman are socialized to excel more in people skill than in systemetizing thing everything good about woman is correct everything bad is wrong because fee fees lol you obviously have a gender bias why do woman not work on technology because the vast majority of them care about people and not things they are technologically retarded and use social manipulation to move up the hierarchy hypergamy this is for reproduction a well they would secure a man not actually build anything of value this is basic biology they pervade corporation a parasitic hr department and diversity department that contribute no endvalue to the corporation because gender quota
NONE your view is confusing to me in several way the current leftright split a it s advertised in the medium did not come about organically but wa strategically engineered to pit the ordinary working stiff against each other a a distraction in order to remove the uneducated populace from the political equation i do nt understand how policy that encourage people to vote can be framed a removing people from the political equation although these powerful interest may differ regarding who deserves the biggest tax break or which industry should be protected in a trade deal one thing they all come together on is that they do nt want interference from a bunch snivelling worker bee who might want free social benefit and for the rich to pay for it out of their own profit but taxing the rich to pay for welfare etc for the poor is exactly one of the issue commonly discussed along the leftright spectrum you in fact bring it up here to dismiss it who deserves the biggest tax break for example doe it really effect the vital interest of the global elite if there s gay marriage people packing gun in walmart abortion capital punishment or prayer in public school why should i care about the vital interest of the global elite over any of these thing you list you seem to have an assumption that global elite doing their scary global elite stuff is just dire and bad and important for it own sake but you have nt explained why people like elizabeth warren may grand stand about banker for the camera but once the horse trading for power happens i m pretty sure high minded ideology go out the door and it turn into a political mud wrestling contest what doe this have to do with your view politics is messy and always will be it requires compromise and discussion why is this bad and how doe it relate to the leftright spectrum
AH the whole point is that the legislature ca nt sidestep common carrier law if they try to use the law to let common carrier discriminate it will be held unconstitutional the bathroom example is an idiotic example the bathroom is not the common carrier the train is the common carrier and it is health code law or some other regulation that require there be bathroom and stop citing example from the precivil right era because a the name suggests and a i ve said several time that wa clearly a time when there wa widespread popular support for not giving some people the right ostensibly guaranteed to everybody when we just ignored the rule and everyone wa ok with it and there just is not that widespread popular support for treating homosexual that way today
NONE i think that there is though ironically it involves u moving backwards not forward the original idea behind ip law is that the inventor or creator of something should have a limited window where they and they alone have the right to profit from their invention those window should be a short a possible enough time to motivate a person to want to discover but short enough where they ca nt have sole control over a useful invention after that it should go into the public domain the issue is that so many ip law have been extended and extended where some item get copyrighted almost forever pharmaceutical are actually some of the best case in this regard a they only get year after invention which mean about year of market sale
AH you do nt have point to refute guy you do nt live in reality you want me to argue with you about pokemon while the house is on fire you re a textbook example of what so many people hate about people who think they know everything based on what they believe they understand about economics get out into the real world and just listen to people instead of barking your bizarre nonsense at them no one else give a shit about your source and they do nt want to hear it they re genuinely suffering and have been for some time the moment you tell them they re wrong because of what you re trying to say here you re going to find yourself eating a pitchfork and maybe you deserve it i do nt know but i do nt see you doing a fucking thing to try to actually make anything better and right now that s the only thing that matter so shut the fuck up with this crap and start thinking hard about solving problem that are really out there instead of trying to condescendingly tell people they do nt actually exist
NONE i think here it s good to differentiate between thing that freak you out you do nt like and think you think are somehow fundamentally wrong or bad like i personally do nt like certain kink andor hobby fursuits also kinda creep me out a little not gon na lie those fucking hollow eyes but that doe nt mean that i think all the people who practice them are horrible deviant they re just wrong for me i also do nt like pickle the color yellow or the movie primer that doe nt mean they re bad thing just that i personally do nt like them like do you think that the people inside the fursuits while outside of them are bad people i do nt i think they re just people who like to dress up like animal which is a hobby that i personally find disconcerting but i try hard not to judge them for it it s easier for me if they do nt bring it up and i do nt picture it they re probably trying hard not to judge me for my shitty musical taste or something else that i like that they do nt we can then all move on with our life per your edit also apply this to the anthropomorphic art etc but i ve known people who are in furry culture in some way acquaintance and my girlfriend it might be harder for you if it s more of a fear maybe putting it that way to the people you know or using the word squick could help you can try to make it clear that you personally do nt think it s a bad or wrong hobby just that you personally have an issue with it and you d appreciate them being a bit more careful with it around you maybe they could share it with you in the abstract or in small dos

AH you re not a very reasonable person are you my post wa nt about politician and specific shitty president and ok you re not dropping wage gap that s fine because there are plenty of fact to deny it like the law specifically created to stop it and the fact that men literally do more work that woman in labor field that involve hourly wage
NONE a delta is probably not appropriate but thank you it s nice that you acknowledged that there are woman who care about fairness for men so anyway what do you think of the idea that male and female are not physically equal so it would be unfair to treat them exactly the same in all circumstance

NONE good point to tell you the truth i ca nt really objectively tell you why your taste regarding something is wrong we all have our opinion i guess my point is that they are nt picking mandarin for any specific reason you simply got unlucky with the language draw if i wa to argue anything depending on your future you have a higher chance of meeting people who speak mandarin based on population and therefore is marginally more important than any other language

NONE diversity is nt only about having faced oppression so let s get that out of the way first in fact this seems to be a fairly common thread in your view here so let s cut to that why do you think diversity is only about having faced adversity i m a middle class white person but if i ve been to party where i wa the only nonblack person there my appearance at such party added to the diversity of the situation even though i have nt experienced oppression in my life because diversity a a concept just mean people who are different and race is one of those factor looking at a picture of a chechnyan immigrant or even just reading his initial application might not inform you that the kid is an immigrant or is anything but your standard white american you simply need more information but a black american s race is apparent so they re considered for diversity without that extra step required it s like with lgbt people we would need to be told that they re gay or trans or whatever unless you have a box to check but they would also count for diversity is nt the best way to end racism to a morgan freeman said stop talking about it and stop acting like it matter i disagree with esteemed hollywood actor morgan freeman on this point you do nt end racism by not talking about race race does matter it matter a lot do you think race doe nt matter to that senator i linked you because that man s race ha had a massive impact on his life we do nt stamp out racism by pretending it doe nt exist we stamp out racism by calling it out and addressing it

NONE anyone notice op calling u selfish while simultaneously arguing that rich people should selfishly keep more of their money amazing one of the worst cmv s i ve ever read
AH interesting hostility i m not going to downvote you asshole because society ha been doing this way for century never a good reason to do anything and it is nt hurting anything that s debatable especially since you imply in your prior post that the practice is misogynistic why else call for it to not be and you mention that feminist will hate this so you do acknowledge that it s at least somewhat offensive going against it will only cause confusion socially how will it cause confusion socially if my kid took my wife s last name is that confusing to people
NONE i ve taken plenty of drug it s completely a choice to be addicted or not i think your disconnect on this issue is viewing humanity a being exactly the same a you many people who become addict think oh i ll just do xyz when i want to like you did except they did nt get the choice to say no before addiction make the choice for them there s plenty of addict that felt like you that it s a choice so they never thought they would be addict who doe drug thinking it s going to entirely ruin their life most people probubly think they can handle it it s just clearly not the way it work

AH oh sorry i assumed you understood how the visa program work i m an immigrant from ukraine american citizen now so i have firsthand knowledge i even know some visa overstayers i think you re making a false equivalency without meaning to the data is this about of illegal immigration is through foreigner coming in on a visa where the government doe a background check input their name etc and the foreigner just do nt go back and overstay the visa limit of illegal immigration is through foreigner crossing our border without our knowledge we do nt take their name nor do we do background check etc now the difference here is that the journey is a lot more dangerous for a borderhopper than a visaoverstayer woman who overstay their visa did nt get raped on their way over here the woman who hopped our border though did get raped a wall would dissuade borderhoppers which account for of all illegal immigration rape
NONE a for point two there s a world of difference irish were shipped across the sea by an empire moving people around they were white and were nt exactly coming from a past slavery not trying to diminish the irish community s hard time just saying these two situation are not the same now most recent immigration wave are constituted of individual rich enough to make it to america i do nt know if you ve been to india or china but i ll tell you right now that the average citizen of either of those country is nt in a position to go anywhere on the other hand you got american often born in the poorest condition so you get the whole lot and not just those with the resource to make it by your logic for instance native american should be on top right now the final point is tied to the second one african american are born in a system barely getting up from segregation and slavery irish coming in did nt need to deal with this history they had a fresh start which the black community never got

AH the government is a state of nature joker government is no different than nature human artifice is nature how do you differentiate what is nature from what is not covenant my dude it wa until it passed the moral event horizon which caused their failure you re really not that great of a troll
NONE i agree with you op i think the crux of the issue here is whether or not there is a set of rule and law that suit all human for the moment i do nt think that is the case however in an ideal world i see no reason a to why there is nt one set of rule and law and way of governance that suit everyone on earth

NONE i totally think polygamy a long a all party in the relationship are consenting and happy is a fine thing i ve heard people use tax a a reason polygamy should nt be a thing because like what s to stop people from having a bunch of spouse for the benefit and such even though you can get married without actually wanting to be married idk but i personally think there should be a way around that

NONE they are much more inspiring if you ask me those are the one that let you stand out of the crowd that allow you to do truly unique work actually contribute to a field and so on what i think you re describing is the mindset of mediocrity the very thing that people have that make them excellent is that they see the curiosity and the inspiration where it really exists right in front of them
AH so on top of everything else that the suicidal person is feeling that s making them want to kill themselves you want to pile on with making them feel guilty about it too wow you re an asshole
NONE you are resting your case on shaky logic then how is it that you know for certain this child would prefer to be dead instead of alive if so why not just give the child the opportunity to commit suicide when they can make the decision for themselves

NONE i m all for voluntary surveillance but having everyone forced to have a camera seems like it could quickly become a privacy issue even if they re offline the government would still be able to know you have that data and request it or you d face the penalty for not having a camera
AH this must be what debate feel like to you having someone s opinion shoved down your throat need i remind you that you stepped into a debate sub and started this comment chain by making a halfasked intellectual lazy glib remark it s not my fault you bit off more than you could chew
NONE you lost me at i m a male feminist is this actually a legitimate title for you or is it used within this context to give insight into your feeling about the feminist movement it feel so unnecessary to brand yourself like that and possibly alienate an audience from the get go

NONE it not pointless to the spectator but it is to the combatant the people around you with a more fluid view might change it if they see valid point against their belief that is the entire purpose of this subreddit
AH exhibiting tame behavior however relies on more than just a genetic predisposition you re directly contradicting what dr lyudmila trut said she said through genetic selection alone our research group ha created a population of tame fox even though you ve failed your class multiple time i m sure that being a medical student qualifies you to contradict her on this so perhaps you should take it up with her directly her email address is iplysn bionetnscru hell maybe you can even get published in american scientist since all the scientist that read it have nt come up with your very how shall i put this creative criticism of her organization s research of course they might not be quite a qualified a you since they re not medical doctorate student it doe not mean that an individual person s iq is genetically determined i do nt think you quite understand the variance is the important part the part that differentiates a person with an iq of from a person with an iq of that is genetically determined we do not know and may not ever know exactly to what degree our trait are influenced by gene v the environment no we have a pretty clear understanding the general figure for the heritability of iq according to an authoritative american psychological association report is for child and rise to around for late teen and adult http psycnetapaorg famaindoilanding doix you are without evidence directly contradicting the scientific consensus the subject
NONE unlike the great majority of the response so far i m going to answer you a a race realist and not try to change your mind on what is likely biological fact first of all i think you should go ahead with the ancestrycom dna analysis knowledge is always preferable to ignorance and you are likely or more european iberian which is good white doe nt just mean being a blonde northerner and the latin people of europe have contributed just a much a others to the accomplishment of our people now to the main part of your concern i think you are somewhat right to be worried but on the whole it is morally justifiable for you to datemarry white girl why because you yourself are likely of above average intelligence even for the white average so you would not have a dysgenic effect on the white gene pool of course if you do nt plan on having kid it doe nt really matter what you do either way although there is some concern regarding your descendant experiencing regression to the mean that particular concept ha le evidence than race differential in intelligence afaik so is of much le importance than your individual capacity which is if you are correct in your self assessment above average finally all this coupled with your understanding and potential promotion of race realism mean you would be an asset to the white race you would nt be individually ensuring the integrity of the white race nor would you be doing it any great damage but you could also argue for the importance of maintaining white racial consciousness from a perspective and vantage point that others pure white can not which would be beneficial
AH hahahahahahahahahahahahhaa cuckold canadian think he can compare to the u have fun sitting back while your autistic daughter and whore of a wife get dicked down by ahmed you fucking piece of shit manlet you re the type of person that would sit back and watch a bunch of nigger rape your family because you d be frozen by fear and white guilt i wish the worst for you and anyone related to you little passive aggressive bitch boy

AH it hypothetical it circumstance that arent real it the implication for me personally and op wa alluding to something similar if you cant see my point that if someone wa a of one sex til a certain age then changed and didnt open up about this to a sexual partner cause thats a pretty fucking huge thing to go through then youre an idiot cause everyone might not be happy about dating someone with that past a op said theyre forcing their view on to someone i dont entirely like that sentence cause it sound anti trans but hey ho just like they might not be happy dating a sperm donor or someone with an std or a rapist or someone who ha been to fucking boston apparently
NONE will mra s pua s and trp just go ahead and admit they re basically all head of the same dragon they do nt even try to act like there s any meaningful partition between their user and raison detre now it s come to the point of trp is correct to regard woman a evil animal to be manipulated because false rape accusation are a thing and also let me tell you about alimony but first i got a killer new neg i got ta share all my bros so they can bag more slut did i mention feminism is basically rape culture is totally doublespeak and also it s totally not rape if i ply a woman to have sex after buying her dinner and get her trashed all while pretending to be someone i m not all night

NONE but i would never presume to censor the people around me because of that that would be selfish and only solidify my vulnerability in the face of those issue can you really call that censorship though censorship is bad when you re suppressing and idea from being expressed at all politely asking a friend to stop making dead baby joke because it make you uncomfortable is a perfectly reasonable request why is it so bad to be vulnerable sometimes about certain issue

AH f you do nt think the government is imposing show your local sheriff a gram of cocaine we the people of the united state no they did nt live under a dictator either sorry monarch my bad i see so it is my failure that someone i never elected for someone whose policy i do nt support but others around me do yup you can pursue remedy but you choose not to this of course is rubbish start your own island nation whenever i hear this argument i always imagine a something with overbearing parent no pretty much all police force are autonomous entity this is not true chief are elected and many city council set agenda for police by holding the power of the purse the fact you are a lone wolf being of the council shoe your opinion is shit and you imagine this government that take meh freedom the idea that any single individual can change a government is absurd we have polluted the government so far that we still think we can change thing but thing always continue to happen regardless of who is in power grab yer gun then right how do you propose we solve this cabin in the wood with a tin foil hat is it more likely that you will be accused of rape that getting abducted in the middle of the night absolutely but which is the worse scenario and what should you be more afraid of if you piss off the wrong person you disappear for life in there were mil encounter with police for age this is according to the doj how many do you think end badly i am afraid of you with what you are posting rather than the chance i m going to have a run in with the gubmint
NONE i m not educated enough in these realm to give any definitive answer but i m sure there are people who can figure that out just a they figured out who can get welfare and stuff like that so you basically want to impose some undefined limit on people but do nt know what they are also what if you were decided to be too poor what guarantee the threshold is going to be reasonable not sure what you mean by that could you explain so a poor woman is found to be pregnant however she say her husband is looking for a job and that this will put her over the line do you a ignore that completely and drag her to have a forced abortion b give her a grace period to rectify the situation case a doe nt seem to be particularly palatable the news would have a field day with that and i do nt think there s a politician that could survive standing behind that policy case b allows the fetus to develop for longer and easily postpones thing until it becomes a late term abortion but now it s not just a tiny clump of cell you re aborting something definitely very babylike in appearance abortion is already politically iffy in the u a goverment forced late term abortion that s going to be politically the worst thing possible it hit a huge amount of thorny issue government interference big government death panel abortion religion you name it the same way you enforce other law i m not a law enforcment specialist so i ca nt give you the detail but there are surely way to check if people are abiding the law right there s civil law where one person sue another this is nt it there s criminal law where it s the state v a person this would be it but the government need to find out about thing somehow so what do you have traffic stop with police checking car for pregnant woman monthly gynecological exam a system where you can report a poor neigbour for examination
AH i ca nt tell if you re just trolling or if you re actually a racist bigot but judging by your response which have been nothing short of handwaving appeal to emotion or shifting goalpost i m going to try to speak in your language with an emotional appealappeal to authority myself the ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seek to destroy instead of diminishing evil it multiplies it through violence you may murder the liar but you can not murder the lie nor establish the truth through violence you may murder the hater but you do not murder hate in fact violence merely increase hate so it go returning violence for violence multiplies violence adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of star darkness can not drive out darkness only light can do that hate can not drive out hate only love can do that good luck with your rationale but i have never nor will i ever believe that violence is a justified response to a social ill anything that would seek to resolve the conflict with violence will always devolve into extermination of the outgroup i m sorry you do nt feel the same way but at least you re not alone every ruthless dictator genocidal warlord and violent social justice warrior that ha ever lived is cheering you on at least you ve got that going for you
NONE you are aware that i m not supporting this view right i m merely suggesting that it s not hatedriven i am aware true but i never brought up the bible a a reason abrahamic religion seem to consistently be the one invoked to condemn homosexuality it s fair to argue that a god would nt command people to repress behavior when it only brings them suffering and benefit no one else but i think it s a flawed argument to say that he would nt create someone to suffer since people clearly are born with condition that result in them suffering you re removing the logic from this argument by bringing creation into it i m not saying god creating someone to suffer is impossible i m saying that if god chooses to make someone—no not just someone but an entire widespread group—suffer when they do nt have to god is kind of a jerk my point is this if you hypothetical you not you personally oppose homosexuality on the basis of religion someone is being a total asshole it might be you using your religion to justify hate it might be someone else in the religion using it to spread their hate either in the current generation or historically it might even be god but opposition to homosexuality is rooted in someones malice and allowing yourself to be a vessel for someone else s is nt all that different from being malicious yourself in the grand scheme of thing
AH if i find a poisonous berry that look like a black berry that doe nt mean i ate a blackberry you fucking retard it s an illusion i wa mislead in to believing one thing is another and believe me thing applies here you know what rhyme with illusion delusion like you retard who think transsexualism is nt a mental illness
NONE i agree a someone who ha struggled with mental illness i wa frequently told i wa like a murderer i believed it too nobody want to help you you re just some creepy weirdo that should really just do one of three thing take medicine til you act how you should stay hospitalized because that s the safest option or simply die so nobody is at risk
AH first a child can not give consent in order to give consent one must be able to understand fully the consequence and responsibility of their choice child can not do that then they do nt consent to their parent they do nt consent to their house they do nt consent to anything and by the state telling them what they can do they are basically ward of the state second pedophilia is not just icky preying on a child lead to very real physical mental and emotional consequence for the child that go far beyond icky it ha nothing to do with sex being dirty child do not consent to sex with adult if that were the case pedophile would not need to spend year grooming them that s very rare you re clearly influenced by isolated report in the medium third when you victimize someone in a manner that ha lifelong effect such a child rape you forfeit your right to claim victimhood when suffering the consequence of your action now i d like to just tell you to fuck off and you re a huge mangled cunt so i will if you think prisoner deserve to get raped i would contend that you re just a bad morally if not way worse than a pedophile
NONE no this hypothetical doe not influence my view on abortion at all i find it interesting because it allows a glimpse into the reasoning of people who want to protect the life of a fetus a if it s a person like any of u that person would nt exist in the first place if you did nt create that situation so you can not say that the act of creating it change the situation i m not claiming that it change the situation but that it lead to a certain situation maybe you should nt create people if you end up poisoning them unless you are certain that you will give them the antidote it is still her body and you have no right to force her to provide it to another we ca nt force a person to give the antidote but we can punish them for the poisoning if they do nt provide the antidote and are you honestly saying that you want woman who get late abortion to be tried for murder i m clearly not saying that a lateterm fetus is not a fullygrown person like any of u if you really need to know my view i am in favour of granting personhood protection after birth it s an arbitrary line but i think it s sufficiently cautious and well established i do nt rule out that a lateterm fetus might be some sort of person by some sort of reasonable definition though
AH if the student will not allow the phone to be confiscated then the student should be suspended if the student repeat that behavior the student should be expelled there are rule for being in certain place if the student refuse to follow those rule then the full force of those rule should be brought to bear on them your primary concern are around teacher abusing student which is a rare thing or a teacher breaking into a student s phone for pervy thing i would be much more suspicious of the student doing pervy thing in class than the teacher the phone should have a basic screen lock on it period factchecking of the teacher is probably not the primary use of the phone social medium texting others being distracted in class cheating on test those are much more likely to happen with a student using a cell phone in class and your misuse of the word they re show that you needed to be paying attention to your teacher more
NONE the problem is that when you start to think that only member of this race show this behavior you can start to filter in unfair way if i am a teacher i can start to think that my black student are the cause of all the problem in my classroom and react accordingly but what often happens in those situation is that teacher end up with a quick trigger when it come to their black student and they have a much different way of handling a situation if a white student doe something wrong they might help that student process thing out they might give that student a warning or they might give that student a free pas and sure they would have data that appears to show that black kid would be suspended for more day or have more principal visit but if that teacher is only sending black kid to the office and giving other kid a pas then that result is what you would expect to see those result would be based off your system of discipline and not on actual student behavior and that s how fact could be racist
AH man really i m not sure what i expected from a redpiller but i thought a fellow programmer might have a greater degree of logic this is just plain ol distractionism it s not just race i m talking about i m talking about the fact that of all child live in family with income below the federal poverty level the fact that more black male were frisked in nyc in than there are black male in nyc and so on and so forth
NONE do you think that the fact that most of these men and woman expressing these view are young come into play i think most redditors are between and that is the age where all you want to do is have fun so the idea of having a child is like having more homework it doe nt appeal to them i want to be a father one day and i am between the age of but there is a lot of stuff i have to do first the idea of a child right now is not appealing
AH x people are better than y people i m allowed to prosecute a person for their belief because x i ca nt sin because y you re a fucking idiot lmao
NONE if your preference is to do it all in one day then no use debating any further so do you agree that for those people in laundry machine are not better
AH til that telling people that they re wrong about the meaning of something they wrote and trying to foist your own view of reality upon that person is not gaslighting that someone who ha a history of having and enjoying long frank honest discussion http wwwredditcomrvideosdiscussioncommentsavxchangesdiscussioncqjani is now a troll because they think something you do nt that labeling people based on what they believe in order to avoid them is not an expression of tribalism and that not reading something because you already know what they said while simultaneously replying to lecture instead of discus is nt actually kind of a bad thing to do thanks for that i ve been learned well by your teachins i ve been on reddit a long time but it s been a while since i ve met someone like you come back in a month and maybe we ll both learn something
NONE evolutionary deadendedness is arguably pejorative i ll start with this why do you feel this way i mean you re not going around telling people you re an evolutionary dead end i mean sure doing that would be wrong but it would be wrong because it s rude is there anything wrong with not wanting to have kid is being an evolutionary dead end something bad if a childfree individual were in any way to encourage one s relative to have offspring past what would have been selfdetermined genetic impact this violates said individual belief rendering said individual a hypocrite a person deciding that for themselves having a child is not the right choice that s a decision they made about their own life and goal i believe that lemonade is the best drink in the world because it taste the best to me i am not a hypocrite for telling my friend he should drink apple cider because i recognize that lemonade might not be the best drink for him
AH it s unfortunate that you find trans people with opinion so upsetting but that seems to be common with you people perhaps more exposure would make you le sensitive to being reminded that we re human rather than robot but whatever to prevent your delicate feeling from being further bruised i ll happily go do something more productive like maybe watching paint dry never let it be said that i m inconsiderate of you people and your incredible fragility
NONE it s okay to express discomfort so long a you understand why you re uncomfortable and that you should feel a though your partner is obligated to cut off contact with their ex for you they might have a very good friendship that your partner value it would nt be very nice of you to make them destroy that simply because you re uncomfortable with it and feeling uncomfortable kind of mean you are expecting something to happen on some level if you truly did nt believe anything would ever happen why would you be uncomfortable
AH if your bar is i am better than a nazi because i let them do what they want then that s a pretty warped way of looking at thing nazi s greatest ally have always been the moderate majority who believe in the power of democracy and debate but do nt want to have to lift an actual finger to defend minority targeted by them one of the most morally selfevident thing you can say is that nazi perform evil deed if you do nt see why violence is necessary sometimes you are privileged you have the privilege of not having to worry that a government will actually end your life have some fucking empathy
NONE your title say i do nt believe taking a human life is inherently wrong well you do think it s inherently wrong because the only circumstance under which you think it should be allowed are if the person you re killing wa about to kill more people if my being about to kill people justifies your killing me then there must have been something inherently wrong with my killing those people in the first place you have to assign inherent value to human life to even get to your current stance on the subject so obviously you think there is something inherently wrong with taking human life
AH cmv i ve never fought anyone or anything but i m pretty sure a wild animal that i know nothing about will let me kill it op you re either trolling or very stupid
NONE i m not challenging it at all op is a police officer i would never challenge a police officer please do nt tell him i m challenging him i do nt want to get shot
AH it s not convenient that million per person wo nt be available when they are child there s still the matter of who foot the bill up front i asked a legitimate question no need to be an as about it but i guess you have nt heard of civility
NONE i think that if it wa legalized there would be more of it that said i agree that we should go after the abusive pimp and try to make their life better in term of health care there s a reason it s only legal in nevada
AH i thought you might have been a troll but based on your post history you really are a obtuse a you seem to be i ll move along now
NONE lame yes but maybe you should award a delta since your view on what you thought delta were meant for have been changed
AH jesus fucking christ dude are you serious
NONE jesus christ do you really believe this
AH if you get this butt hurt over me categorizing a culture that s your problem this is irony
NONE yeah but man you even admit in your original post that filmmaking alone is not what make a movie great
AH oh god you are unbearably stupid the backwards bending demand curve ha nothing to do with the argument that supply and demand is widely accepted how is it possible that one person can be so confident and yet so dumb linking to a political source and an unrelated wiki doe shitall for your argument a well just so you know
NONE and that is where i would say absolutely yes and that is why it is a philosophical discussion you can argue that it can be heard because the sound wave would be perceivable by something with that capability and i could argue that something is nt perceivable if there is nothing to perceive it the consumer of the signal is a critical point of the definition
AH your writing just reek of autism
NONE of course it is it s your life
AH let it go you obviously did nt understand what i wa saying and only listened in so far a being able to argue around in circle i am done with you i do nt care what you think christ probably did nt preach harrassing someone on reddit to try and fight about exactly the nuance of love he wa talking about and who that allowed you to hate you are not smart jesus died for you and here you are acting contrary to how he would have wanted in his name that boggles my mind go argue with someone else and leave me alone
NONE certainly any two people life can be compared but to what end i have read of former slave who never left life of sharecropping but they seem to have been at peace in way that i long for would i though wish that i had been able to live their life i am frankly glad that i do not have the choice flipping it about what if some thing that i experienced in my childhood had happened differently in my leisure i like to think that i would be a happier person and easier to get along with but they happened
AH is he no longer to be regarded a the great emancipator only someone ignorant of all the struggle that went into emancipation would give lincoln that kind of credit so no i think you would be hard pressed to find a race activist who would give that revered of a title to lincoln he did not morph into a totalitarian dictator insisting in all way it must be even though it would have been done against the will of the people this idea is so hilarious yes freeing slave would make him a dictator even if such a ridiculous statement made any sense he could have freed his own slave no oh wait he had that power but did nt exercise it yeah fuck him his speech did nt include any mention of feminism or gay right and they did nt help immediately achieve equality for all everywhere he wa an activist for civil right at the time he did nt actually have power over policy and if you ll recall he wa killed for pushing people with power to make those change activist do nt have the kind of power that policy maker do
NONE perhaps but now we re straying from the topic of equal right equal left and debating on what exact point a violent response becomes excessive i m not going to argue that the concept embodied by that phrase is nt centered around violence because it absolutely is but have i not demonstrated the equality side of it a well if a tiny guy slap a huge guy get punched and then complains that the punch wa unfair because he s so small and weak nobody would come to his defense he would probably be ridiculed for picking such a stupid fight and told that he got what he deserved make him a woman of equal strength and stature though and suddenly we have this huge crisis of gender inequality and social norm which is bullshit if you start a fight whoever you are you should expect the other party to finish that fight however they see fit they may cross the line when they do so and that s not acceptable either but the location of that line ha nothing to do with gender that s equality
AH we do nt have any with china omfg i just ca nt even take this anymore nope no trade deal with china http tccexportgovtradeagreementsalltradeagreementspeoplechinaasp and obama is nt trying to get another one going http originwwwusccgovsitesdefaultfilesresearcheiureportonuschinabit finalaprilpdf that s going to destroy your economy even further http economyincrisisorgcontentfreetradeamericascommonenemy a if the tppttip is nt destructive enough already http wwwpbsorgnewshourmakingsensetranspacificpartnershipfasttrack for what because a bunch of people got brainwashed by the medium to think trump is actually a bad person and zomg an army of robot is going take our job those phd s in economics have spent so much time with their nose buried in book that they are now too stupid to see the simplest thing that any year old can clearly point out are nt those the same educated people that told the government to bail out the bank back in go ahead keep exporting your job keep telling me it s all a myth and keep telling all those jobless people to get a real job that doe nt even exist anymore lol whatever
AH i think that one of the reason that donald trump won is that the le educated poorer people who really wanted change voted for him against their own best interest who are you to decide their best interest do you know all their situation do you know their life their problem you ever think that they know what they want and need better than you do in this way we would be letting the more educated among u determine who is the presidentsenatorsrepresentatives i m not gon na let some asshole with a master s in the beatles http mentalflosscomarticleunusualmajorsyourcollegeprobablydidntoffer or a phd in folklore http wwwindianaedufolkloregraduatedoctoralshtml have more vote than me because i needed to actually make a living and support my family it s well known that with more education you learn to think to yourself more source because i disagree those with more education while not entirely one party tend to lean democratic which is the party that is most concordant with reality in pretty much everything in my opinion there it is people that agree with me should have more vote that s your real view and it bullshit
AH if you want to kill yourself go ahead and do it no one is stopping you
NONE i can literally go through every one of your point and dismantle them i choose not to
AH i feel like i stumbled on a riamverysmart post in the future i d recommend using clearer word to get your point across if you google definition of scapegoat you get a person who is blamed for the wrongdoing mistake or fault of others especially for reason of expediency when you say the scapegoating of the other that s pretty easy to disprove what do you mean the other how trump want to build a wall along the mexican boarder but he still got mexican vote clearly mexican a a blanket ca nt be the other who is this person who is being blamed the people who illegally come over people can still legally immigrate to the united state from mexico the reason trump wanted the wall were not because liberal do nt want it the reason were that it will hopefully reduce the number of illegal immigrant secure our boarder which i fail to see why that should be a controversial point among others but regardless
NONE you basically tell people that people who punch neonazis are no better than other people who use violence to achieve an end the end do nt justify the mean if people do nt get that what ground do they have to stand on you need to debate those idea when you use violence to express opposition over word you lose credibility you seem petty you play into their narrative your argument appears weaker because you resorted to violence instead of properly breaking down the idea that being a neonazi is not a good thing if i m against abortion and i decide to punch someone who almost insultingly brag about the ability to get an abortion what ground do they have to stand on when they are upset that i punched them if they also punched a neonazi call me crazy while this country wa founded on the principle that we can argue instead of resorting to violence and that that is why this country is suppose to be so great
AH why are you still commenting back to me holy shit i do nt get people on reddit when you recognize they are a troll and you tell them to go away they somehow still manage to argue with themselves i do nt get it so now i have to block you you should really try harder to understand why jesus would teach u the thing he wanted to teach u then thing would make sense then you would nt argue with yourself in circle and would nt hate in the name of love maybe not idk cause you re obviously not the sharpest tool in the shed but you are a tool i ll give you that
NONE ok so that wipe out the need for the gilded to say thank you make sense it doe not though in any way affect the gilder their right of anonymity are not being violated in anyway and if they see the comment again they may smile and feel good about themselves if they do nt see it then it doesnt really affect them the gilded can still say thank you if they feel obligated too though if someone save your life and then run off before you can seethank them you can still shout out thank you or post on your blog that you appreciate it
AH she is not a prominent feminist well it s a good thing i did nt say this so you ca nt hit me with a fallacious accusation of making a no true scotsman argument what evidence is there that some outside force is keeping their interest in these job low society enforces gender role gender role lead to favoring particular career based on gender there s nothing inherently female about becoming a nurse instead of a doctor a if there wa a difference in wage for the same work there is though depending on the number you use it range from to choosing a lower paying job that provides better quality of life doe nt make you a victim of discrimination choice is nt made in a vacuum and there is no evidence that it is caused by discrimination against woman sure there is you re just being willfully ignorant by shutting down any curiosity about what s natural and what s learned the fact that we tend to make different choice doe nt represent a lack of equality that precisely demonstrates a high likelyhood of social inequality i m still waiting for someone to put forth a rational basis for the claim being made because your incurious mind end at legality a though the word of the law is the endallbeall of human social situation
NONE i agree that affirmative action is bad in it current manifestation but i do nt think it s bad because it s racist though i would say it focus on race is probably a mistake what i like about the idea of something like affirmative action aa is that it s essentially a bandaid to some unidentifiable or unfixable social problem that said i think what s happened is that aa or the people implementing it have sort of lost sight of what it s trying to solve what s the goal what s the endgame solve racism end racism make up for it in some way help people in need it need a refocus clearly stated goal and a method of tracking whether or not it s successful i like the idea of need based scholarship but not race based scholarship for instance i like the idea of some sort of quota based off of classincome rather than race for certain job i fail to see what is being solved if a rich black kid can get a scholarship or a job position that a rich white kid might ve otherwise gotten how is that raising the floor for people in need aa in it current iteration is nt a permanent fix to society ailment it ll make up a bit for some of the racism in the past but it s going to have diminishing return in that regard once society equal out in that regard a more permanent fix would be to simply have aa focus on helping the poor or lower class whoever that may be at the time without explicit consideration for race
AH fuck you i wa nt using fuck directed at anyone until i ran across this list making precious little snowflake who ca nt handle the word fuck used in a colloquial manner for emphasis i would maybe possibly understand most average people not to know what aleppo is however most average people are not running for the leader of the free fucking world you ca nt see the difference because aleppo is a very significant region where most of the significant development in that region are happening and one would expect any candidate running to become commander in cheif would have extenisve knowledge of aleppo and not in their wildest dream would ever consider that a presidential candidate would not know what aleppo is hence the you ve got to be kidding remark fuck you
NONE i think what i found wa that even when it seemed like the group wa overwhelmingly negative when i stood up for what i believed in i often got private message of encouragement and occasionally even sparked minor rebellion in the group if people then cracked down on these rebellion they lost member from it i guess my point is a lot of the people in those group would agree with you about being negative they just might not feel comfortable argueing when they feel like they re in a minority you do nt have to be trying to fix the group or change people mind it s about the audience and if you can get a load of people who care to see what you saying valid thing in a calm and reasoned manner then it doe nt matter if a handful of manhaters have a go at you you ve already won
AH receives government funding the government while this is correct it is absolutely irrelevant to the point people on welfare receive government funding and it is true that they are not the government but on the point of whether or not public university are state actor you are still incorrect sweezy v new hampshire u keyishian v board of regent state univ of ny u healy v james u i could keep listing case but a i said above this is well settled
NONE the state can do some thing that is true but a mcculloch vs maryland http enmwikipediaorgwikimccullochvmaryland established federal supremacy in matter such a commerce where do state receive the money for landfill for farming and for alternative fuel yes they have autonomy but they receive federal fund and they trade with other state under federal law and federal regulation a state doe not run an autonomous economy it is not selfreliant and if it can not make import or export it economy will founder
AH sigh no dna wa altered when you pick out one specific cut of beef at the supermarket are you manipulating the beef no all you re doing is picking the one you want it s like that jesus mary and joseph what the fuck are they teaching in school these day have the dropped the biology requirement in school in the two year since i graduated
NONE so based on the response you ve been giving i can only assume that you have not been in college for long every course you ve mentioned ha intro in the title and the lineup make me think freshman year gened class maybe sophomore if that s the case i d suggest withholding judgement until you ve taken the hard class in your major
AH once again you are missing the point seriously i get that you wan na get high and do whatever you want but be logical i not once have said beat people up stab them etc etc you sound like a year old trying to put word in my mouth if i am sitting on a bench and i set my drink next to me on that bench and a sober person trip into me and accidentally knock it over i would likely say oh well it wa an accident i am saying under this law if a high person tripped into me and knocked my drink over i would be justified in throwing them off onto the ground either way i think people should just do drug in their own house sober people do nt want to deal with you
NONE yes absolutely they ve never done anything like that but i m sure there will be a time that a baseball will go through a window that is nt mine or a kid will knock something off a shelf and break it myself of myself the kid if they re old enough will make reparation i m ok with someone making a comment to me it s happened in booth before where my two year old will be kicking his leg in a booster seat and it s shaking his side of the both which can be felt by the person sitting behind him and i did nt notice it i apologize and ask my kid to stop or move them to my lap if they do nt there s a big difference between talking to me in an adult way and smacking a kid though
AH you re all a bunch of circle jerker and it s painfully obvious whether you re trying to do it or not i really do nt know why this subreddit is autosubbed bigotry taking advantage of fear etc people defend his action at a totally different standard than the average person there is clearly still hate in this country and based on so much of what drumpf ha said he is quite misogynistic and racist give quotesevidence so far i have nt seen any liberal able to provide a quote from trump that fit the traditional definition of racism discrimination of race besides are you kidding me literally everything else in that wall of text is just apologist subjective opinion or quoted fact such a hillary s history in politics i ca nt change your subjective preference opinion whatever all i can do is debunk claim with evidenceburden of proof and the only claim you ve made is that trump is racist also what make you think hilary having been in politics for a long time is a good thing i thought bernie supporter were antiestablishment if you re proestablishment when facing a backlash to puritan egalitarian doctrine then you ll be proestablishment forever because that is the establishment
NONE i would say so being an anarchist only really say something about how you think the state should or rather should nt be governed that s all the phrase say about someone belief everything else is undetermined maybe they think a man should be the leader of the family maybe they think a certain hierarchy of road freewayarterialcollectorlocal eg would work really well maybe they think blueeyed ginger are the masterrace that is superior to all others i m just making thing up now a you can probably tell but my point is you do nt know what other idea they might hold if all you know about someone is that that person is an anarchist all you can conclude from that is that they are opposed to a political hierarchy everything else is still unknown including whether or not they re against all other form of hierarchy a a result anarchism is a subset of complete egalitarianism so an argument against complete egalitarianism is not automatically an argument against anarchism same go for communism btw your post wa removed because you did nt respond within hour to the first commentors you can probably contact the mod to put it back up
AH are you fucking kidding me trump supporter inciting terrorism the radical right is minuscule in number compared to the left it s not even a fucking argument the protester blm the medium celebrity speaking out for the death of trump holy shit i downloaded this app today and your stupid shit head of a comment is the first thing i m replying to also stop sympathizing modern socialist you manipulated fool
NONE can someone explain why every person on the right of the political spectrum is a nazi these day what about libertarian they re literally on the opposite end of the spectrum from the extreme authoritarian nazi also no one ha actually tried to prove that milo is a nazi it s just the same ad hominem slur i m very interested to see evidence of these accusation also prove milo s white supremacy and racism too please
AH what you have claimed here is highly presumptuous so much so that i am comfortable dismissing it outright youre kind of pretentious then would you mind giving me the common feminine trait that are abundant amongst men the same trait that are abundant in woman and if you really think im suggesting every man ha feminine trait youve foolishly misinterpreted everything ive been saying the majority of men are slight left of center leaning towards masculine but few men are extremely masculine by nature and the number of men who are are feminine are hardly statistically insignificant slightly feminine or nuetral men tend to pair up with slightly masculine or nuetral woman woman who are not themselves excessively feminine dont tend to prefer excessively masculine men this is all ime of course
NONE i am sure there exists a tiny minority of people who claim they are x solely for the attention i also imagine that most people with common sense can recognise which people these are to address your other point gender identity ha nothing nothing to do with being feminine masculine or liking stereotypically feminine or masculine thing you get femme trans woman butch trans woman feminine trans men and butch read masculine trans men plenty of people the medium interview are nt actually all that knowledgeable on the subject even though they are supposed to be which really help false information propagate i m quite willing to help answer any other question you may have i do nt have much to do in the day atm so feel free to ask away xd
AH how did you get delta when you ca nt tell the obvious difference between legal personhood and the colloquial usage of people
NONE seems like you agree with me that liberal do nt always follow their core value of tolerance they make exception when some other more important value come into play

NONE so your plan is to ask him question until you pin him down in some convoluted thought process you create really convincing
AH just because it a survey and they are estimate doe not make them any le scientific or true yes it doe just because i can point to a survey that state of american believe in ufo and alien http wwwusnewscomnewsarticlesmostamericansbelievegovernmentkeepsufosecretssurveyfinds doe nt make it true a fact or scientific in any way there is nothing about the methodology of the survey to further validate it dgu is simply put any incident where a person usespresents a gun to stop an attack against them so it ha to be an attack against them so if i see a guy breaking into my car and draw my firearm and say get away from my car that doe nt count under your definition of dgu got it good so the guy with the alarm at his business that s still a defensive gun use apparently not according to your definition there wa no attack against him besides if that guy did nt witness them committing an actual crime then he just opened fire on two random people in their car totally illegal but if you do nt care about legality then you must be counting all the gang shooting in your dgu estimate so gang member shooting back at police is a dgu one b report doe nt automatically dismiss the rest you fail to see the significance of the study these estimate are only a good a the methodology used to generate them if the methodology is flawed like not discerning legal vs illegal gun usage then the estimate are pretty much useless my guess is since you lurk on grc nope i just have a bot that search reddit for the stupidest comment and yours just pop up all the time your comment are just nra talking point you do nt even understand you re not informed enough to even discus these topic and when you re called out on them you flail around and just come off even more incapable

AH except they ca nt on the day of sandy hook the same exact day a chinese man attacked a school with a knife he had more victim than the sandy hook shooter and yet every single one lived with no permanent damage why do nt we fight war with knife why did warfare and society change radically with the invention of the gun because it is the most effective killing implement ever designed with hundred of year of warfare behind it and virtually no practical defense the idea of comparison between knife and gun is absurd
NONE and a a specific craft level it made it story wider appealing than any of the other disney movie because all of the character were animal kid of all race and creed could identify with them that is also one of the biggest reason it had such a high world wide gross because their were no human character there wa no disconnect between the character s look and the language that wa dubbed in business wise that is a coup art wise it opened up the story in a way the other three could not

AH what are you fucking retarded i m not saying burn the poor people i m saying do nt give handout to people who voluntarily remain poor by being lazy
NONE i do not think that people should be going around trying to find out who these people are since it often lead to innocent people being falsely accused
AH that s the stupidest shit i ever heard that s clearly the implication first of all and second of all if people would respond to that then they can make the fucking connection if you ca nt make that connection for yourself and think abotu it a little then you re just a moron fighting to be right rather than an individual trying to build knowledge i do nt actually give a shit you can think whatever you want and so can everyone else what people know is not my responsible and most people are too stupid to learn from proper reasoning anyway
NONE well firstly if it make them happy and doe nt cost you anything why would nt you play along with it even if you think they re full of shit in that sense i do nt hink you can say you re apathetic in that case you would take the easy way out and just play along but more importantly why do you believe transgender people are roleplaying what do you know about the cause of people being transgender i believe there is some evidence for there being a biological cause in that case i do nt think it is fair to say that they should just suck it up and conform however even if there is a strong psychological cause to the distress caused to them by their feeling a being born in the wrong body helping them deal with this issue doe not seem unreasonable
AH i m not a convinced a you that these feeling ca nt be changed i think they re strongly societally informed this is exactly what people in the s said about gay people wtf is wrong with you
NONE i believe you are of the popular opinion edit i would explain why but that go against the purpose of the forum i only commented incase you do nt see many comment and wa wondering why b
AH are these sincere and serious question or are you being a deliberate asshole it s easy to to see how you asking these question are simply the act of a troll they re pretty darn basic and simple but i understand everyone ha to start somewhere if you re being serious then i suggest you learn yourself all that basic shit and then come back here you need to have a fundamental basic understanding of your view core concept before you are able to discus any discourse or debate by asking such question you are demonstrating you lack that basic foundation
NONE a a voluntaryist i definitely do nt want to change your view however asking this question on cmv assumes that other redditors have the knowledge and understanding regarding classical liberalism which i believe very few do i m not trying to come off like an elitist but i ve had these type of conversation several time with the same tired refutation until they actually do the reading and research we will continue to get the same canned response thank you for your understanding of classical liberalism we need more people like you in this world
AH lmao this is the most retarded thing ice ever heard you clearly never swam
NONE it too bad it represents a bunch of dick because ive always liked the design
AH haha holy fuck rape by deceit damn i thought this wa a discussion but you just killed it by living in your ignorant little world where they re poorly portrayed chicks with dick in brated movie

NONE just wanted to say that this is great thanks
AH your first two link are five year old so are you honestly telling me that hamas ha changed their way in the past year do you think the jew trapped in the ghetto of warsaw were wrong to rise up against their guard typical moving the goalpost http enwikipediaorgwikimovingthegoalposts you realize your last argument is a dud so you change it without acknowledging you were wrong i really should nt engage such an ignorant question but here go anyways the palestinian are nt trapped in gaza any more than mexican are trapped in mexico israel ha a national border with gaza that it chooses to keep closed egypt also ha a national border with gaza sometimes it s closed sometimes it s not the purpose of putting the jew in warsaw wa to exterminate them israel did nt put the palestinian in gaza and it definitely ha no plan to exterminate them despite what you and your ilk would have u believe the jew in warsaw did nt have a charter that dictated that their purpose is to kill all german seriously this is such a retarded hateful and ignorant analogy i ca nt tell if you re trolling or if you honestly believe this bullshit rhetoric
NONE good point but i really messed up by mentioning jew because they are irrelevant to my argument i wanted to say that it is possibly too dangerous to let militant radical group of people that already shown hostile intention to let them form state to say that a group is too dangerous to form a state presupposes we have an obligation to destroy any state or organization that is hostile to u where doe that end global occupation iran wa too dangerous but now we re looking at them a potential ally one ca nt just say that we have to do something without first sketching out what that something look like and also looking at what the strategic response are from the other major player if we start killing sunni fighter on behalf of maliki s shia majority not to mention assad that would alienate the entire sunni world and likely make the u even more of a terrorist target the only way to win this game is to not play until the sectarian issue are resolved and if we ca nt resolve the israelipalestinian conflict good luck with this the middle east border a currently drawn are not a stable equilibrium
AH i know i m wrong and ca nt back up my argument thank you for giving me a challenge i win again however i wish you the best of luck with your tool of ignorance
NONE no double standard here except that you down voted me for disagreeing with you while i have not down voted you for the same reason thank you for proving my point with your action
AH like many people have said there ha never been an example of true socialism you can put layer into capitalism to mimick socialism but it s still capitalism just le efficient you seem incapable of understanding that profit doe not mean money if i exchanged hour of labor for someone s service say driving me place i d consider i profited even though no money wa involved if the point of the last statement wa nt to promote socialism then i do nt understand what the point of the statement is at all are you telling me that capitalism doesnt have childcare
NONE it is much harder to gain support for something that people are nt already doing suppose there were no gay couple because of sodomy law those law would never be repealed because the awareness in society would be so low if nobody ever tried pot why would people bother to advocate for it for all they know it actually is super dangerous i agree that thought crime is orwellian but you said earlier that having the idea to set up a terrorist support center should make you a suspect or maybe i misinterpreted that i think there s a text code to make delta in the sidebar
AH well you made a lot of good point until you turned into a grumpy old dick for no reason
NONE sorry to bear the bad news op a a short ugly guy myself it s going to be slim picking for you
AH because there s a difference between something being covered in shit and briefly touching the floor even a dumb fucking american like you should be able to comprehend that for me it s a waste of food to throw something away just because it fell to a floor it cause absolutely no disease for a normal person and the only downside it ha is the yuck factor personally i also find it funny how horrified american are about this at the same time when they walk their ass covered in shit because none of the barbarian have a fucking bidet in their bathroom
NONE i find it funny that while the op did possibly mislabel the problem here it seems that no one is willing to talk about what he brought up reiterating his point about a problem no one is willing to call out everyone seems to be picking out race and arguing the wording of his post but the problem here is that some people in le fortunate situation derive pleasure from ruthlessly beating a helpless person or harming others in general this doe come from race some white people are raised to hate black people and some black people are raised to hate white people there s no way of getting around that
AH edited lol you seem to be leading u in circle in this and the other thread no pun intended could you clarify how your present argument is different from that put forward in the other thread which you happened to have abandoned in an apparent deadend thanks
NONE maybe you should stay away from social medium for a little while this may include reddit too i feel like both side of the political spectrum just look insane thanks to the internet and the ability to post whatever thought you have regardless of how asinine
AH if the electoral college is nt fair or democratic then it would have and should have been rectified long before dissatisfaction from the outcome of an election not when some people simply are unhappy with the elect if you truly understand the electoral college which requires a greater level of reading comprehension you would probably surmise that it is likely more fair in more situation than a popular vote blaming the electoral college is simply jumping on the band wagon probably shared with staunch extreme leftwing people
NONE the point of a democracy is not to have the most effective government the point of a democracy is to represent and reflect the will of the people not just the one that are educated thus in order to get the best representation of the will of the people every citizen must be given the opportunity to vote no matter how uninformed they are you re looking for a more effective government but by doing so you re ca nt have a democratic one like it or not an idiot s opinion count just a much a yours
AH these are nt new argument these are argument that have been had since america began catholic were one of the many previous spectre that haunted the ignorant
NONE because they were not heavily segregated in the beginning in fact there were no law that made it possible for segregation to happen that is why you never see it
AH you have nt disproved with evidence anything i ve said in face you entirely keep skimming over several point i ve said when i gave you a list of damage you did nt say why that is or is nt the case you just said no so at this point i m not interested in continuing this unless you want to bring so counter evidence to the table to debunk the thing i ve said prove to me this wa nt misrepresentation prove to me there are no damage so you also entirely avoided answering the several question i posed where i asked if you actually knew the entire situation which make me think you do nt especially considering they took a clip of him point at something and made it look like a nazi salute this wa not some kind of poor choice pdp made this wa obvious wsj taking a clip out of context to make him look back either bring some evidence or fuck off
NONE i agree with your premise but i feel like the argument you are basing it off of is wrong especially since it s either hearsay or you are assuming his intention behind building it even if they may be true i just know the reason i would have to do thing if i were to do those thing especially at the same age when i wa his age i tried to make a firework by emptying out the powder from a bunch of those cap gun cap soaking a fuse of cotton in lighter fluid and stuffing it all inside a toilet paper roll it did nt work though but since it s hearsay and assumption a long a he doe nt admit his reason wa to make a convincing looking bomb no one can accuse him of it or punish him for it i m sure he wa told by lawyer to not talk about his intention too it is really sad and pathetic of everyone trying to scrounge for some medium attention for something very simply built the stuff at a middle school science fair is far more difficult so i believe the argument should be based off of is how difficult wa this thing he built is anything that happened deserving of all of this attention and money and what should have his punishment been if any
AH this is a bunch of people who have studied and read about this saying yeah that sound right no this is a bunch of scholars who s job it is to perform historic research who now have access to original source material saying that historian working on the archive have nothing but opinion that that sound right is completely idiotic that s not how historical research work
NONE the term mouthbreather in my experience on the internet is basically never used to criticize people who actually breathe out of their mouth for doing it it s used more along the same line that fedora or neckbeard is to indicate that someone s attitude seems like that of someone who ha a neckbeard a fedora and mouthbreathes because these are generally unnattractive characteristic to have tl dr it s a meme
AH enough because empathy is almost exclusively granted to woman and not men what utter sexist garbage only a man hating feminist would say something so utterly retarded men have lot of empathy idk why you get this notion that we do nt

NONE i think that your body should be the one thing you are certain of is yours and only yours giving a bureaucratic instance such a a government the power to not only take your life away but also the power to change your body the way it want to is scary a hell your body should be sacred and yours only no one else should have a say in what to do with it i think this is an important principle we need to hold on to a a human
AH fox news and the republican party spent nearly year trying to convince people that the aca and obamacare were separate thing you know fox news is smarter than that they never say they re different you re an idiot republican tell their base to be scared of gay people muslim people black people and foreign people and to vote solely on those issue and what about the s of thousand of republican that are not straight white men my closest muslim friend from the boxing gym is a trump die hard cutting their police department and trying to force everyone into a system where you have to be rich to make it uh no republican definitely support better funding for police police union and police officer are always majority republican and a far a supporting the middle class i think clinton crime bill in the s and the dems welfare system is continually oppressing poor and working people here a funny lil video thats tangentially relevant http wwwyoutubecomwatch vcjuxbg im not surprised that many people dont know obamacare andf the aca are the same thing it s only ever refered to a obamacare but there s no one out there that love the aca and hate obamacare trust me i actually live here pal
NONE my parent are middle eastern but i wa born in the uk i m a muslim but that doe nt mean i simply hate you or anyone because they are gay or whatever the case may be i think it come down to the fact that i wa born in a society that accepts gay marriage and the like these immigrant have cultural rub off from elder or are not exposed to people who are gay and then this toxic attitude carry over to where they end up i however am fine in the company of gay people the society i live in ha shown me the other side of the coin ya know there s gay celebrity and teacher etc so i ve been exposed to all type of people i d sure even my parent and extended family who have lived here a long time would nt cast aside a friend once they realise they are gay and by the way what you re thinking is fine it s only natural to be concerned for yourself i agree that there are load of bad people moving into country they ca nt adjust to i think that it s good that young people especially are coming to western country so they can learn about equality and the like early on and be exposed to lot of type of people this will help the future generation a that bias in their head will be gone in the end we re all human hope this help sorry for the rambling peace

AH thats like saying because you could drown in the bathtub you should nt wear a life vest while boating on a lake you are dumb if you think it doe nt minimize the risk for the scenario op pointed outits about reducing risk not eliminating it we live in an imperfect world grow up quit whining about this or that and be proactive about your own safety
NONE it how and who they sell to imagine being denied health insurance because your friend on fb post picture of dangerous activity i can deduce that you are a high risk and make it more expensive for you to pay these are the type of concern we have when it come to privacy or what if you are denied a job because a friend ha racist comment and they dont want anyone associated with it
AH slower method that avoid people dying are proof that the law is bad them having gun is the only thing that slowed this down otherwise they d have been thrown out immediately their gun force a dialogue grow the fuck up you sure sound real mature here
NONE ghost do nt exist story you hear on the internet are paltry evidence unless they can be backed up with something tangible and verifiable if the believer had that science would be turning on it head over it right now you are right not to believe in ghost
AH you deliberately misconstrue my point in a bizarre way a if i implied that the rest of people were rabid huffington post reader or daily show watcher if you think those people are the uninformed mass then you are clearly one of the partisan few i m talking about it s clear that you have an agenda here it s far too authoritarian and elitist and topdown controlling for my taste i agree that voter do nt always want what i think is the right thing but i do nt agree with your obvious plan to try and skew the electorate your way by excluding people you do nt like and only including a deliberate minority besides voting is a right and not a privilege it is not something you have to qualify for and people should be able to vote for whatever reason they want without you trying to suppress their right i have more faith in democracy a opposed to other more elitist system and i do nt believe your system enhances it in any way by suppressing it and deliberately adding to confusion with this sort of contemptuous attitude that they should do everything the hard way the most reliable voting group is the elderly and activist special interest group if you think those people are on the right side of history moreso than the big population center well i guess that explains your intent anybody could come up with better idea that would more proactively increase information in the world and minimize distortionary effect rather than punish people for their perceived ignorance by taking away information because you do nt want them to see it and to think my position is antiintellectual is absurd i suspect your usage of the term republicrat and democan is much closer to the kind of false equivalence aasimov is talking about
NONE no he deserved to be ignored this is how violence work in a civilized society you do nt get to use it without government sanction the government say you can defend yourself or other people if there is immediate danger but apart from that you have no legitimate right to use force that principle underpins civil society and ensures that we do nt start incorporating violence into the norm of political discourse you do nt punch people for saying what you do nt like because it provokes an escalation and it keep escalating until we re killing each other we fight with word because otherwise we use gun and nothing anybody say will hurt you more than a sucking chest wound so morally speaking you do nt punch people because that s the small part you play in fending off the chaos that could kill a lot more people than you anticipate your petty selfindulgent illegal reaction make you feel strong and powerful but that feeling is paid for with the erosion of our collective peace and stability and what you think about the truth of their narrative is totally meaningless they do nt agree with you they see it differently and this action will predictably have the effect i described that they re wrong is irrelevant it will happen anyway if that were nt true radicalization would nt be a thing there are people who might believe these thing if exposed to the right evidence like this video and your opinion there are people who believe them and there are people who believe strongly enough to kill for them video and opinion like yours are far more likely to shift all those people towards the extreme than anything else that s just a fact and whatever fuckwit decided to upload this ha probably made the largest mark on the discourse that he ever will and he helped nazi
AH obvious troll is obvious
NONE that is simply not true
AH you re awfully attached to your little ad hominem tantrum considering you do the exact same thing in your argument just le directly just enough that it is nt a logical fallacy like all these argument you throw around a question and then provide no factual support other than should be this way or should nt be that way that s selfcentered businesstalk that i see every time i look at any political speech made by a businessman why should nt i have my way i should have my way it is the way of freedom everyone benefit except not but you wont know that the problem with your example is that you re trying to wiggle in an innocent looking practice a just that while we both know that it not a single action removed from context itself that is the problem it the intent that guide the trader into making that action that in long term cause problem these problem destabilize the market a multitude of way and turn them away from the purpose that they were created to serve the world is full of thing that could be used in a nondestructive manner but can not be allowed because another group of people will misuse them to destructive effect
NONE i know it may be annoying yet legal but the implication of being able to directly spread dogmatic propaganda to the mass through an otherwise intimate mean of communication seems to be something that we a a people should nt have to stand for i would argue that law is not necessarily the only or even best recourse we do nt make it illegal to be ugly for example yet most people will spend a great deal of money trying to make themselves more physically pleasing running directly to the law is with respect a lack of imagination there are way you can punish this behavior for example recording these call and making fun of them in the medium comedian have a lot of fun with bad political commercial you can do something similar to ridicule the behavior and make it le popular in fact government will have a hard time arguing against the st amendment right of the politician or his shill the government need to show that it ha an interest in doing so ok fine let s agree it s annoying and should stop but that this is the least intrusive way to accomplish it goal that is certainly not the case if you let the government make something illegal simply because it ha an interest in doing so and do nt force it to demonstrate that it s the only way it can accomplish it goal you ve just screwed over the entire legal system all the government ha to say is we think the world would be better off if this were illegal doe nt matter if the new law is intrusive
AH weasel weasel weasel my friend

AH namely that the pc movement place the burden on me to just accept everything they throw at me while placing no burden on the other side to make their case you seem to think that no one ha made a case for why we should use certain pronoun for transpeople when all it take is second of googling to find million of word making that very case your argument is essentially just whining that you do nt want to do the work of engaging with the argument basically your view here is i m lazy and i do nt want to change
NONE you ca nt reason from result back to probability after the fact for example i m guessing you would nt argue that any possible arrangement of a shuffled deck of card is too unlikely to have happened naturally with your line of argument you re logically committing yourself to the position that no random outcome is attributable to chance to ask why you and i specifically exist requires that you and i exist to even ask the question if we did nt exist then other people would be scratching their head in our place over their existence
AH it s done by private citizen because private citizen want to do it are you really so outoftouch with the real world that you ca nt figure out why hunter hunt
NONE so when we have thing happening like congress continuing to purchase weapon for the military that the pentagon themselves say they do nt want you do nt think that s a place where we could spend money more efficiently
AH and you re a moron who think your poor poor life is just a bad a being a muslim who get called a terrorist and is constantly watched you re just selfish and want to further your progun agenda
NONE moonflower is always aghast at why they re being treated like a long term antitrans bully after spending year twisting the fact to argue against anything that would benefit a transgender person
AH i already admitted i wa wrong about the mongol please get the fuck back on subject and show me that no gun is worse than gun

AH you re still getting the flag wrong so i d say a little googling is nt really sufficient if you want an accurate picture and no one is not a product of the other state right wa a massive and incredibly important political divide that op seems to be way off base doe not justify your insufficiently researched opining
NONE i would argue that the sometimes people forget excuse is merely an indicator that people are unintentionally being selfish and is not a reason to explain that people are unselfish i agree with you op apart from a broken blinker there s no reason to not use it and not using it is always selfish it s just not always intentional either
AH jesus christ sorry you re not smart enough to make all these hoop you re jumping through make sense to everyone else
NONE um yes they are because the u is the only country required to let them live there they cant just decide to move somewhere else and expect it to happen
AH i m not angry i m using bold to separate him from the hypothetical alt universe whatever and do nt be an as if you ca nt understand a basic concept do nt resort to insult
NONE i think it should be up to op to consider whether it s worth awarding a delta for one can hope they act in good faith but i do nt think that it necessarily necessitates a delta
AH setting aside any desire i have to engage in fantasy of government being evil yes it really is but do nt believe me go do the research yourself find out where the people who need the food are located find out the capacity of the food shelter around them find out the average donation to those shelter consider how probable it would be that they could meet the need if the government stepped away consider from where the missing capacity would come from consider how much labor it would take to deliver food to people in outlying area consider how much more efficient it is to simply pool money present those people with a debit card usable only for food an to fund thing that way there is no way the problem can be addressed the way the libertarian neocons who think you can just stop paying snap benefit speak about it moreover if you required each community to meet the need entirely independently most area would be highly precariously situated even if they could miraculously meet the need which currently they could not the reality is that snap is extremely efficient and it provides benefit at a level that can not be replicated in the private sector in large part because the need is so large but no the gop just use rhetoric instead of actual research and planning to say it s possible once you start actually looking at the number the reality of the situation put the lie to the rhetoric right now there are million people on snap even with that program in place and all the current food shelf taking part in supporting their community in the usa of emergency food need go unmet and the average family on assistance ha unmet food need each month so the gop plan is to take a system that is already insufficient to meet the need and remove the most efficient component of the system which also happens to be far far more than of the current solution that will make thing better how
NONE we re already spending that money on those item so the money clearly exists it s just a matter of how it is spent on those item do we collect it in tax first or do we set up a separate program or do we find another way to do it completely the reason many of u are against for profit medical care being the only source of medical care is that simply by the need to turn a profit the money spent is not going towards care which mean that money that could be discretionary for the patient becomes a mandatory expense please note i said only there is still a place for private medical institution but they ca nt be the only source many state and local government have been on a gop led privatization kick for school hospital jail etc insisting that the open market can provide these service le expensively than the various government can the result are to put it kindly mixed those of u who side with bernie sander feel that the government is only completely inept in joke and that the basic care which ha the most demand can easily effectively and more efficiently be consolidated under a single payer system similar to the rest of the western world by increasing access to regular basic care we will automatically bring down the bill for pediatric care by eliminating the need for poor family to go to an er for an ear infection a an example for school we would merely be increasing the subsidy already in place for public institution and allowing our recent graduate the ability to leave school without crushing debt not to mention increase accessibility to those who would like to go to college but can not afford the cost or risk of doing so currently the money definitely exists it s just a matter of altering priority
AH your statement implies that all palestinian woman and child included are fair game to be killed and that not a single civilian life within gaza that s fucked up and you disgust me
NONE only if there is a child there are lot of relationship that wo nt result in child any many relationship that are accepted and have great risk to child like someone with huntington s
AH so basically you believe that rape victim would rather be dead than cope with being assaulted thanks for your vote of support i ll kill myself right away for the crime of living on your watch you believe that rape should therefore be punished a a murder would but there is no rational basis or proof involved in why we even have sentence for murder in america putting someone in prison for rape involves desiring for them to be raped over and over because that s what will happen congrats you re a rape enthusiast and you want all rape victim to drop dead so that you can feel more righteous fury and then you leave with an argument that we should mutilate these people on top of raping them and taking away their entire life through prison time you are much much worse than a rapist not to mention that when woman raped child like me there is virtually no justice fuck you you re a piece of shit
NONE i will concede the difference in action before and after a crime is committed but what i do nt like about your knacker analogy is that the severity of the crime is the important part of course i would forgive you but if you killed my wife instead of kicking me in the ball well that hold a lot more weight a a society we have deemed that particular crime a severe enough to be put away if you manage to escape and then do good thing those activity simply do not function a get out of jail free card we would like our justice system to be a fair a possible not imprisoning people who manage to evade arrest for murder for several year because they have done good thing since then is inconsistent what kind of message doe that send this basically mean that it is okay to kill people and we should nt send them to jail if they manage to evade arrest and do a much good shit a possible before we catch them
AH what are you even doing on this sub
NONE did they change your view on anything

NONE how about just make a separate section for the trans people that way no confusion take place
AH you did nt really try to understand let s try it again together seeing something a not natural or not liking something doe nt make you obligated to disbelieve it i swear it s like the world is pro or anti for any topic ever for most reddit user it s never just black and white and we should never make it so some people get paid to agitate and lure others into making useless argument while dividing common folk this of course lead u nowhere and waste a bunch of time and effort let s not drop that low you wo nt make everyone love the idea of having a homosexual intercourse most people wo nt bat an eye and wo nt have anything against some folk exercising that there will be some angry people ready to go all out against it and while it stay on paper or a a word we should tolerate their opinion too anything above that line should be punished just a it would be in every scenario but before that we can try to understand each other a bit more
NONE then again doe nt it make it easier to know who will be attracted to you right off the bat i mean if i like a girl knowing that she s straight will be useful because i ll automatically know she wo nt be attracted to me also it s harder to define with trans people i think that s more on a person to person basis when it come to bi people it s safe to say pan people are attracted to them all the other nonbinary gender that generally do nt fall under the bi label also we must keep in mind that there s more to it than just gender while most people wo nt have an issue with the gender they identify with they might have an issue with preoppostop difference for example or people who choose not to go through with the transition at all or do nt go all the way generally speaking bi people have more strict rule when it come to who they re attracted to that doe nt automatically mean bigotry if trans people fall out of that spectrum
AH it not a question of whether it s productive and frankly i really dont care because this issue isnt at all important in the grand scheme of thing it s not some great injustice that you cant use literally word and it s not like every rap song ever us it to the point in which you cant sing the song there are plenty of more important thing to be worried about than whether white people can sing along to a song i think you should reflect on why this is such a big deal to you because this is absolutely a nonissue frankly i am trying really hard not to laugh at you
NONE it s common to any form of communication where your opinion is likely to be judged like the example i gave before where people say you will probably disagree but it s just normal to identify a controversial opinion of yours a controversial if you really think that it is of course it s not necessary but i do nt think we should be reducing all of our post to only their necessary component to some degree we should feel free to post conversationally there s no reason why we ca nt add little personal view to thing in much the same way we would in facetoface conversation
AH i m laughing at you in case that wa unclear
NONE ahh but i can do freericeorg while i m at work
AH i do nt see omnipotence a a suite of power it is the absolute knowledge of everything that s all it is extremely versatile but it is only one power if you want to call it a suite of power then i will argue that rewind is a suite of power the ability to rewind time the ability to adjust the amount of time rewound the ability to remember what happened before the ability to make change with known aftereffects ie a deterministic timeline where the same behavior always result in the same outcome and so on i could probably spend some time actually building a list of subpowers that comprise rewind but since it s an exercise in theory the difference between a singular power and a suite of power is completely arbitrary redefining what i think is a singular power a a suite of power in order to disqualify my argument is idiotic then again this is a cmv about super power so what the fuck did i expect
NONE i do nt know exactly which interaction in the brain are that susceptible to quantum phenomenon i m neither a biophysicist nor a neuroscientist i have merely been to some talk where in the background material this wa mentioned to then go on to the math ruling that world now the thing is that when you had to choose between an apple and a snicker to use the example of uferoc you had to take a measurement ie decide which one you wanted and therefore collapse the wave function which according to chaos theory would be enough to change the future and it would be impossible to know how not from a computational point of view from the very fact that the system is chaotic because even a minute change can or also can not change everything else afterwards this is similar to the much fabled butterfly effect the thing is we are asked to change view about the mathematical function ruling u all what i am saying is that if such a mathematical function exists then it is not deterministic
AH who is saying that people do not read harder
NONE should have why is this so hard
AH are you wearing a fedora
NONE are you the front page
AH yes i read what you wrote you do nt have to be a douche did you read what you wrote it s no longer in force because it ha been perfectly satisfied christian are under a new covenant a new set of moral and practical teaching for life find some example about that then you were provided with an example that you refused to acknowledge if you are nt here to debate and you re just going to argue semantics you re on the wrong subreddit
NONE your view is basically that more cooperation and le fingerpointing is likely to lead to more progress who could argue against that it s a completely sensible proposal however you ve put forth your idea a a proposal for the future this is what we should do going forward i ve pointed out to you that it already happens and ha resulted in progress ie i ve argued against your fact if that doe nt change your view could you tell me what you think would change your view edit a word

NONE you ll be hard pressed to find people who will try to change your view here i think antiabortionists only goal at the end of the day is just to punish woman for their promiscuity not that i m trying to ignore all the nonreligious antiabortion folk but they truly are a small minority
AH what you linked me is propaganda at best but it s okay with a flash of your majestic finger across your keyboard two sentence that are nt even aiming at my point s direction and a mind closed tighter than fort knox you have won the debate congratulation feminist keyboard warrior by simply being irrational wrong and somehow condescending about it victory is your s huzzah
NONE if you do nt like it fine you can argue about taste i liked that it wa so subtle and only gave hint which made the player imagine the detail himself instead of telling the whole story but whatever what about my other point chara subplot asriels story kill or be killed deconstruction giving an satisfying conclusion denying redemption you totally ignored those
AH you think a candidate who is openly racist bigoted sexist attack judge in public ha no regard for our international relation and ha a campaign slogan that literally harks to an era of disenfranchisement for black people and woman ha le likelihood of eroding civil liberty than someone who ha supported gay right racial equality and is the first woman in history to be nominated for president by a major party you so strongly believe they are both lying and will abandon those lie completely once in office that you believe trump could be a more liberal president than hillary clinton how is that not delusional am i taking crazy pill
NONE that s certainly not an unreasonable conclusion to come to white people are responsible for so much black misery it s almost impossible to count from slavery to voter denial fraud it s always been popular among a certain group of white and enabled a inevitable by another but if you look through history there s a third group white willing to fight and even die to help africanamerican earn their fair share whether it s thousand of white unionist dying to end slavery or the white pacfist james peck being repeatedly beaten in the nonviolent war for black civil right it s this group that show not all white people are evil tea partier racist republican
AH yeah why even get up in the morning why not crawl into a hole and wait for the world to burn do nt forget to bring your xbox and cheetos dufus
NONE got ta feed the industrialmilitary complex they all do this trump will find a way for himself to profit off violence if elected of course
AH man fuck off you know what i m talking about you re just attacking the way i m presenting my argument you re just saying that i have nt defined my scenario clearly enough and yet you still know what i mean you re just arguing some specific term you know exactly what kind of scenario i m talking about when i say purest form you re just trying to win the argument by arguing against my title that is not changing my view in any way whatsoever take a look at this http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsjncmvthefamoustrolleyproblemandtherelatedcqgxjbr this is the thread where i awarded a delta i m specifically talking about the ethic behind the life and death not the ethic behind separate but related event in the scenario there s a difference according to some moral framework between the scenario even in my purest form situation simply because of some term such a the nature of the action also it s not in any way a no true scotsman fallacy that fallacy specifically applies to universal claim which are then adjusted if the initial claim is no true scotsman put sugar on his porridge then it is still a valid claim the issue with the fallacy would have been if i later adjusted it to a purest form my claim started with the purest form adjustment you can argue that i did nt define it well enough but that just attack my presentation that doe nt attack or attempt to change my view in any way
NONE i really appreciate the lack of legalese you ve gone for but i can handle a bit of it i wa basically anticipating uhuadpe and upepperonifire jumping in here and doing their thing no worry i m sure you can part of the reason for my abstracting is that i think the merit of originalism become clearer when we move away from the fraught political context it can be hard to disassociate the doctrine from the conservative soil in which it flourish but in principle there s nothing binding originalism to any ideology a socialist constitution could be interpreted along originalist line eg the right of people to have healthcare originally meant state provided healthcare darn these living tree privatizers i understand your point but to go from oj to bourbon is a little incredulous though i would nt mind your point would be more apt if the shopping list only said juice since it say orange juice i think it s reasonable to expect juice squeezed from orange my favourite is florida s natural the problem is that you are for lack of a better word reasonabilizing the living tree position once we ve established that orange juice mean orange juice we can understand why constitutional provision mean what they do then we re just wondering how to find the correct originalist interpretation which may be a messy process if the provision in question is ambiguous
AH big·ot a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinion thats you buddy i m done here psfor those wondering study after study pew ha shown republican more informed than democrat and world leader how trump respect with the exception of foreign obama colluders like angela merkel
NONE did you not see the last part of my post with multiple link showing that a a group republican are more charitable than democrat the follower of neither major political party in the u are giving away all of their money which is likely what christ would do but the republican are closer to that than the democrat so i just do nt see where your perception is coming from

AH are you mad or something you are acting kind of childish
NONE usually this is okay you can ask the mod if you want though
AH i am so sick of stuff like this why do you think nationalism is an acceptable mean of determining boundary so what happens after there is an ethnic kurdish state all the nonkurds become second class citizen and get forced out of their home you think the kurd are some shining light do nt be dense just because they are supported by the american the truth is no state should be ethnonationalist that s an idiotic concept and the best basis for state is generic religiousethnic secularism where citizen are citizen regardless of their identification edit the most annoying thing about view like this is that is indirectly justifies the minority s exclusion from the majority ruled area how do lgbt people like living in place that are based on the gender binary they hate it because identifying a state by a single characteristic is by definition exclusionary even if the intent is to support the majority
NONE i think you may be focusing too much on overt racism and not enough on institutional racism a white cop killing a black kid may be an instance of overt racism but if so it is only a symptom of the much more subtle issue of institutional racism a to your two example of minority succeeding it s important to remember that the fact that some member of a minority group succeed within an allegedly unjust system say nothing about the justness of that system one might argue that these people succeeded despite a flawed system not because the system isnt flawed i would contend that a significant majority of america ha assimilated into a state of peaceful homogeneity in term of race could you elaborate on this point a in what is meant by assimilation who is doing the assimilating and to what culture are they assimilating
AH is that supposed to be some sort of shot you throw together some half as analysis sprinkled with wannabe biting one liner and that s it man hop on a treadmill and lose the trilby

NONE i think week later is the perfect movie for you to watch it show exactly this how doe civilization rebound while taking back the land the zombie took
AH the whole point of cmv is to respond to and critically analyze other point of view and compare it to your own point of view in the other thread you started with a fallacy and then deflected i think you re the kind of person that brings this place down it s my pleasure to block you now
NONE i ca nt change your view when you re not wrong i recommend the book the ultimate resource for an explanation a to why overpopulation is indeed a myth a further evidence you could give every human on earth a x foot plot of land all next to each other and the total area would be fit inside the state of texas

AH actually no i m not going to let you go on your idiotic gaffe you said i intensely delved into the syrian civil war while it wa happening not i only paid attention to it while i did nt have other thing going on in my life it s impossible to interpret what you said in the manner in which you say you meant it you actually thought the syrian civil war wa over you liar your excuse for your ignorance wa just a fake a your candidate and if you did nt if you really only pay attention to the news when it s convenient for you spending the rest of my time hyper focused on yourself a you claim in your excuse that s exactly what i m criticizing gary johnson for if your two setting for paying attention to the world is not at all i ve got my own life and writing letter to my senator first gain some fucking balance in your life and second why should anyone listen to anything a bipolar obsessive like yourself ha to say about anything political pay attention constantly or get embarrassed like you have here and like gary johnson did good thing your excuse is bullshit and you really thought the war in syria had ended huh
NONE you re right to a certain degree unless there is some information he doe nt have like she s cheatinghas a prison recordis donald trump in drag then it s not your place to tell him that he s an idiot and he ll regret his choice and you forbid this union young man but there s another choice between ignoring it and tell him he s an idiot you can have a wow that s a big step conversation and then you can add in some of the stuff you think is a problem man i know how anal you are about people leaving a mess in the kitchen and her apartment would be closed down by the health department how is that going to work or i know she s not big into gaming and i d really miss our tuesday game night you still going to be able to join us by making it into a problemsolving session rather than a your girlfriend suck bitchfest you have a much better chance of getting him to think about his decision instead of defensively sticking up for his gf but at the end of the day it s unlikely that anything you do will have much impact besides potentially damaging your friendship if you rip on her a you said it s his mistake to make
AH i do nt mean for it to be compelling it could be but i ca nt be bothered doing a literature search for someone who s probably too stoned to read any of it

NONE i d like someone to address the issue you brought up about denying you entry altogether to be with your friend a you stated you did nt take up any resource allocated for the minority group therefore it seems to me you were excluded solely based on your skin color and not any kind of threat that you would steal benefit from those le privileged i d also wager that part of your tuition money went into the upkeep and funding of that buildingprogram a well
AH jesus this is the worst cmv i ve ever read

NONE that s what they said about the jew you are a nazi fuckin screwdriver nazi
AH the ad hominem argument claim that personal attack of bd supporter are logically irrelevant because they focus on individual character act andor motivation rather than on the argument for or against the bd initiative in and of themselves this line of argumentation chime with the word of university of california berkeley professor of sociology claude s fischer when he writes it is certainly true that antisemitism fuel the bd movement but most of the fuel — and the greatest problem for western defender of israel—is the occupation it settlement and the ugliness it often brings that is why for example one of the powerful voice at the berkeley bd meeting for the proposal wa that of an israeli graduate student who had fought with the idf in lebanon fischer suggests that the rightwing israeli hardcore may stop up their ear shut their eye and yell antisemite a loud a they can but they ought to listen to people who have legitimate criticism of israel and allow them into the mainstream conversation
NONE assuming by we you mean western country like the u or the uk there s a huge difference between the holocaust and the comfort woman or hitler s invasion the latter two do nt really have an impact in the west other than having a better understanding of history but holocaust denial is nt just about getting the history right there is a much bigger story here according to the anti semite in their telling the holocaust is yet another lie told by the powerful jewish manipulator who secretly rule the world and the lie is used to unfairly gain sympathy for jewish cause and this influence is used in presentday politics in the west it becomes justification for further antisemitism and impact daily action of these people that s very different than refusing to admit culpability in the treatment of comfort woman or conveniently forgetting about internment camp for japanese american or other revisionism based on inconvenient truth yes there is also the aspect of fairness and justice for the direct victim of the holocaust comfort woman interned japanese armenian killed by turk etc but those are all glossed over event rather than one that are used a proof of a living conspiracy

NONE red pill doe nt force anything down your throat but society ha been forcing bullshit like rape culture in woman and even letting you think thing like woman being paid c for every dollar a man make is on par with unequivocal truth that should never be questioned lest you be labeled a misogynist do you really want to live in a society that considers you disposable or would you rather change your frame of mind to believe that you are the prize and not some beastlike rapehungry portable atm made for woman s use it s all on you the red pill is like pandora s box you know now that it really exists and what s to stop you from opening it up and seeing what lie inside i can guarantee you you wo nt want to take it none of u did it s a harsh gritty reality we have to face when we look behind the curtain and see that it wa never really u in charge the red pill is a chance to take charge again if not for everyone else but at least for your own life

NONE i m not sure if this count a challenging your view but batman is never portrayed to be mentally healthy or stable or making the most rational decision i mean think about it why the hell would he go after criminal himself if he wa acting in a rational manner he s rich a ball he could hire thousand of private mercenary to do way more than he could ever do on his own to clean up the city even a batman but he doe nt because he s a profoundly fucked up individual fueled by his own psychosis part of which includes never killing under any circumstance

NONE why do you want your view changed this action by trump is clearly indefensible all the people trying to challenge your view are bringing up exceedingly weak point for example several of the top comment are saying transgender people are mentally ill in saying that they instantly reveal that they are uneducated about this issue trump made a shitty decision because he is a bigot he ha done this many time there is no solid reasoning behind it that you need to understand

NONE i am a gay guy a similar age to you i am more the opposite i am fairly out sexually active and i am in a loving relationship with another guy i know this is nt what you want to hear but life is too short to be thinking about life that way no offense but one day when you are older you will regret this you will think about the missed opportunity and stuff like that human are nt meant to be lonely we are social creature who need companionship to have a happy life taking a slightly different view from others what is the worst that can happen if you let yourself experiment with another guy youll probably love it just like year old me when it wa my first time thinking about fear the worst thing that could happen is that you could catch hiv but even if you did it not a death sentence anymore i am just saying there is nt a rational reason to do this if you use protection and i hope to god you would then it harmless sex between two guy or girl is probably far more powerful than heterosexual sex men know male body so well same for girl what bit to twist etc you have no idea until you try it to be fair pride is a different meaning i used to be the same a you but i realised what it meant to be now i am a fairly militant gay guy i sent you a couple of pm i think you need to speak to a councilor or something i used to be full of self hatred like you i cut myself tried to kill myself once it hard to see a way out you will feel so much better

AH they dont own the worker and force them to work a nonliving wage live in reality why do you need to be such a suck up do you think they re going to reward you like a dog the whole idea of a living wage varies based on a person expense not this idiotic argument again do they give you a handbook to copy from is there a website a page on mi or something start with a minimum in every community family can get subsidized eitc if it doe nt suffice just start with pretending to be humane do you realize how stupid you sound

AH this is such a shitty attitude everyone s struggling guy everyone is from time to time inconvenienced by someone else but we get over it and move on because we re adult that s a bold assumption to make everyone doe nt just get over it because they re adult you responding to me is an example of not getting over it we re all struggling to survive and thrive lol maybe if you lost a few pound your struggle would disappear everyone s pretty different from each other but most of u are similar in one thing we re all kept down by people who would rather pit u against each other than have u turn against them who are responsible for all the problem we have if you feel like you re being oppressed or something that s on you buddy if your feeling get hurt by keyboard warrior than there s a bigger underlying problem you should also keep in mind this is rchangemyview where op came to have his view changed which is what i wa trying to do not fight with people who hate fat people so we should just leave your opinion alone because that s not what we came here to talk about if you post your idea on an open forum you should expect people to discus those opinion if you ever want to have a talk with a real fat person and get a different perspective i d love to talk to you sometime and maybe do so but not here not like this and not with this adversarial attitude oh ok can you please enlighten me a to why being obese doe not equate to being a burden on society i could use a good laugh today

NONE i agree with you it s the shop s choice and yes although it really suck to be turned away but i think the best choice would be to shop at another place i think the only reason to be against it is from a pragmatic business perspective it s counterproductive you could say if you can get money why would you refuse it s not a if they re forcing you to become gay or partaking in it and you re potentially losing business from not only gay people but progay people too boycott and social justice however to argue against it from a moral point of view a bit more difficult you really ca nt force people if they do nt want to

AH if we are honestly arguingthat this is a cost issue doe that mean imposing these restriction also mean reducing the amount of food stamp given out if not then i do nt really buy any argument that depends on reducing cost it s not a though we give more welfare to those that buy more expensive food the money is spent from the taxpayer perspective the instant it is loaded onto the ebt card nothing more can be saved or lost at that point the argument ha no real merit in that regard a for fairness a person not on welfare is equally entitled to spend what little money they have on steak and lobster and presliced cheese and if they run out of money they run out of money just like the person on welfare if you think being on welfare give you an advantage to eat like royalty that others do not have then you do nt know what it s like to be on welfare and fuck anyone that think poor people are nt good enough to have a steak once in a while
NONE in my opinion property tax are the only just form of tax there is no just reasoning behind somebody saying i know you and your friend contracted to do x job for y dollar but i m just going to step in and take some of that anyway or i know you and that dude decided that you should sell a product for b dollar but i am going to make you pay me a fee to sell it but land is something completely different there is only a fixed amount of it the market ca nt just make more land should demand increase taxing land therefore encourages people to use their limited resource a efficiently a possible to cover the cost of the tax good and service are really easy to define in term of ownership but with the land the only thing you can claim is i wa here first and even then sometimes that s not the case if that s the only way we can determine ownership people should nt get the benefit of having exclusive use of the land and not having to pay back the community for that exclusive use of it

NONE there are obviously some exception a police officer who is willing to endanger a violent criminal in order to protect an innocent victim doe nt represent a net negative impact to society that said i think i understand what you re getting at to fail to respect another person s right to live is to forfeit one s own claim to that right is that a good way of putting it if so i would point out that the decision to threaten the life of another person is often the product of a hypothetically avoidable situation people who are violent a a consequence of mental illness can be treated criminal can be reformed do nt you think you re overlooking the fact that people can change think of the very worst mistake you ve ever made how would you like to be defined by that moment for the rest of your life
AH the rmovies example is a bad one you did nt get downvoted there because you had a different opinion you got downvoted there because you were being a dick there is always going to be people who do nt like a movie we get it when the movie just came out and most of u liked it your bitching is just a downer it s like going to your school hockey team after party after they just won a big game and spending the whole time telling everyone how you do nt even really like hockey all that much and you do nt get what the big deal wa because the other team wa nt that great anyways you can share your opinion later that s fine but most people who are going to be reading post right after a movie came out are still pretty stoked about what they just saw tl dr fuck off buzzkill
NONE i mean that s a nice ideal but it seems pretty clear that it doe nt always happen you do nt always get to pick your teammate and bulgaria wa clearly a weak team it is nt krum s fault that he ca nt trust them to do their job he can only trust himself since they ve proven unreliable if you re playing a game watched by the entire world with a team that is embarrassing themselves further by the second with a history of being subpar and carried by you would you really keep playing for hour or day waiting for them to man up i d probably have made the same call given that spotting the snitch is a huge variable he may not have seen it again for some time or he may not have beaten lynch to the punch later

NONE it doe nt have to be a sketchy establishment it could be just one sketchy waiterserver that managed to get a job there even highend expensive place have problem with identify theft based on server stealing number off of debit card it s not really unreasonable to suggest that maybe you should get your beforehand which i ca nt do under your proposes system you are assuming that i will know ahead of time you ve discounted the possibility of a spontaneous decision what if i m out to dinner with some friend and someone say hey let s go down the street and get some drink what am i supposed to say oooh sorry i ca nt i do nt have cash and it s after so i ca nt go to the atm that s an entirely unreasonable position

NONE there s nothing preventing him from being both
AH so instead of responding to anything i said much of it using alreadypresented statistic you disregard all of it because i did nt google trans suicide rate and copy that into a link i think you re not cut out for debate sometimes you have to actually discus idea instead of number
NONE i m not going to be any help here other than saying i think you are right i think they are all bullshit the top comment reference bank eliminating proposed fee not the draconian fee they already charge for any little thing like talking to a teller and some horseshit about a cartoon a cartoon i like but seriously that s all you ve got
AH right so what you re saying is that you think i m wrong for suggesting that gun ownership ha significant drawback but you refuse to cite any source or back up your assertion in any way you think this is a real discussion no it s just you trying to nitpick minor semantic issue instead of really addressing any point i make it s no wonder you do nt understand the difference though i m going through your post history and it s full of this stuff lookie here http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsizukhcmvpeoplewhoopposeimmigrationareselfishlydtrr a post where you try and draw people into a stupid debate about the exact definition of third world instead of actually addressing the point made by the original poster post previously http wwwredditcomrchangemyviewcommentsizukhcmvpeoplewhoopposeimmigrationareselfishlydkrbf he make several good point and develops an extended metaphor that you could try and refute for intelligent discussion but instead you go off on this incredibly hilarious tangent when his usage of third world doe nt fit your precise definition even though literally everybody in the discussion know what he mean it s like your post are a distilled form of adhd
NONE the reason being that if you re going to the comment section you are looking for discourse and not just quality content what maybe on this sub but not anywhere else all of the content is askreddit is in the comment both joke and story in most comedy sub the content in the comment is a important a the content in the post itself a too apathetic to rebut in which case i do nt believe they should have the power to hide your argument from others or influence others view about your post see my assumption or b do not have an actual argument to put forth and are just going with a gut reaction to your post in which case they absolutely should nt have the power to hide your post from others right it sound like your problem is with downvote abuse not a lack of explanation if people stopped downvoting for the wrong reason explanation would be unnecessary also it would force the downvoter to really think about why they re downvoting someone which might make them reconsider their initial reaction would it let s say i am your average downvoter i m probably downvoting out of anger or disagreement rather than because the comment is offtopic or rude so when asked to write a comment i will just spew out my own vitriol on how stupid that comment wa on that line of logic it seems it would create more terrible comment rather than fix anything
AH their is a chasm of difference between could and willare many of u could do a lot of thing doe nt mean it will happen it s the difference between theory and practice if you say should happen fuck you mind your own business i mean that facetiously but i m illustrating that you have no knowledge of what each overweight person need
NONE ok i understand where you re coming from but hey while i m here i ve noticed a small discrepancy in the content of your current post and that of your op it seem you support ubi which would be a direct contradiction to libertarian thought how is that you can hold that view and still maintain that liberstarianism is the one true political philosophy that literally everyone should follow

NONE if i changed your mind a delta would be fantastic and mind you i m actually entirely for basic income but removing the minimum wage at the same time make it impossible to predict combined with nationalized healthcare it can work but you need to make tax incentive to pay back at least partially what those who do nt need the basic income need
AH fucking lel it s impossible to tell if you re trolling or not but that is the dumbest statement i ve seen typed out all day
NONE i think that if you only listen to the most popular hiphop music then you could make that argument this here is the truth
AH no actually we most emphatically do not know that you re referring to longdiscredited popular myth not science i know you worship him a a hero or what the fuck ever but seriously
NONE if the religious aspect of bless you bother you you could always say something like gesundheit which is also a common response it s not necessarily a choice between bless you or saying nothing
AH everything you ve said is nonsense and i m quite sure you re either very young or abnormally uneducated so let s shift gear how often do you think someone steal a bait car or sell drug to a cop or proposition an undercover cop for sex and that wa their first time ever committing a crime without any shadow of a doubt people that get caught doing these thing have done them before and did nt get caught this idea that they re just some everyday joe with a clean record who s only committing a crime for no other reason other than because the temptation is right in front of them is rediculous
NONE that is very true but i suspect that the fact that the bad minority get looked at a criminal more than the good one see drug above ha a great impact on how they grow up and who they interact with if you are more likely to have an older brother in prison do you think that might make you more likely to think like a criminal and mug someone sure the individual is ultimately responsible for the act but what make them eventually decide that is a good idea i am sure the way society treat people who look a certain way is a major factor it s expected of them just like asian are expected to help you with math homework
AH nice ad hominem i guess it just go to show that when an ideologue doe nt have an argument they ll demonize the opposition good work i guess
NONE i doubt it but a a trump supporter i ll keep my mind open a i always wa a thought that perhaps the election could be rigged not that it would could
AH you want to escalate to name calling that sure make your point more valid actually no no it doe nt you re still wrong assault is a threat aggravated assault is a threat with intent or a deadly weapon battery is physically touching during the act of assault manslaughter is accidental unintentional or negligent homicide nd degree murder is an unplanned spur of the moment homicide and st degree murder is premeditated planned and on purpose homicide all of which differ by intent why you did it and method armed or not not by how hard you hit when you did it and none of that still ha any bearing on if a man doe it or a woman doe it because according to you and your logic no woman could ever possibly commit an assault crime on a man because they are nt strong enough to do damage and surely you re not that stupid are you
NONE i do want to stay by saying that in essence i think i agree with you what you re arguing by the way is against a philosophical concept called consequentialism http enwikipediaorgwikiconsequentialism which say that the consequence of our action determine if they re good or badevil now one expansion on the how can you be sure argument is that jury may be far le likely to convict if they re not sure the attempt wa genuine since that might send someone to death row for something they did nt mean to do related is the no harm no foul principle this is the tendency of people to not want to punish if no or le harm is done causing grievous bodily harm is a border case and already accounted for in our legal code again i agree with you in theory but in practice it could lead to unintended consequence
AH your line of questioning is retarded
NONE your opinion on this matter is irrelevant

AH you are making shit up in your brain he wa nt saying the definition of anecdote wa a story to illicit an emotional response literally no the op said a bunch of anecdote are totally irrelevant when responding to my point about global terrorism they then went on to say anecdote are used to create an emotional response which is retarded because practically everything is meant to create an emotional response why are you afraid of islamic terrorist because they decapitate innocent people on tv this ha absolutely nothing to to with anecdote nor doe statistical analysis have any merit on this opinion if we were having a discussion about food poisoning and i brought up major instance of dozen of people dying due to food poisoning in first world country like france it would be very relevant in debating the danger of food poisoning in usa your mental gymnastics are impressive btw
NONE i would like to attempt to elaborate this point there is the small world element to be considered when speaking about violent crime a young child s world is small it consists of them and their friend and family place they have been it s tiny in explanation of violent act in particular to put all the violence into their small world particularly into the life of child unaffected by violence is just too much to fit in that world when explaining difficult thing such a violence it s also important to avoid negative effect like nightmare and phobia which is why there are nonsensical lie and euphemismsand such i ve focused on that in comment twice now because i do nt know what you re classing a lie and such i m keeping it very board in my mind but some clarification might be fun child are just a capable of dealing with this information a child thought i should let you know about that
AH this post is golden and demonstrates exactly what we are talking about thank you for that you are most likely not stupid however when you disagree with me your opinion is stupid do you notice the difference you can be smart and have a stupid opinion you can be inherently good but have an evil culture both the culture and the opinion can change it s a choice have a good day yourself edit i forgot to respond in kind are you always an asshole
NONE op you and i have the same view it might be a glass half empty position but i do nt think there is anything you can do about it ultimately i feel like the american people need to stop being so divided on every goddamn issue and make a collective choice freedom or safety you ca nt have both and you ca nt make everyone happy airport security is a perfect example of this you want to fly safely but you do nt want to be inconvenienced by bullshit procedure pick a fucking side

AH fuck those tranny weirdo and freak changing everything to accommodate those asshole they do nt deserve special accommodation and privilege also woman restroom are significantly dirtier than the men s ask anyone who s job is cleaning for a living fuck your stupid as idea
NONE i love how you automatically demonize those who are wealthy whether you like to believe it or not the wealthy class wake up earlier than you work longer and harder than you and ha way more stress about their asset rather than you and your shitty motorbike and flat how dare you
AH is there anything anyone can say to change your mind you came in here saying you are correct and everything everyone else belief is false you re incredibly defensive and needlessly aggressive in all your response you just feel like you are owed some extra validation by the medium or something i m right everyone else is wrong why would they even consider presenting something other than what i think you sound like an insane child
NONE i do see what you re saying but why do you feel that selfefficacy can only come from this type of fighting if mma fighting did this then your claim is nt needed can you clarify why this personal development ca nt be found through other mean nbsp also do you think this type of fighting might discourage calmer simpler mean of solving a disagreement if you become comfortable with fighting to solve problem why do anything else

AH kek at citing a fucking feminism hate piece from a men s right website http wwwavoiceformencomfeminismmosthatefulquotesof come on dude your bias is showing and it s making you into an idiot and where did she or any nonteenage feminist argue to take listen and believe literally is very clearly not the same thing a asking and where did she or any nonteenage feminist literally argue to listen and believe a in where doe a feminist want there to be no legal measure or recourse for the accused rapist which is what you said that they re arguing none of the above quote are arguing that at all are you trying to argue that police should not listen to the possible victim of rape and that they should not believe them when they accuse because that would mean there would be no investigation at all
NONE it is nt damaging to free speech freedom of speech is your right to say what you want and not receive punishment from the government for it university are private institution and them saying do nt say x y or z doe impede on your right to freedom of speech an ymore than me telling you not say racist thing in my house doe also do you think all speech at a university should be acceptable some thing are inherently vile why should a gay student have to put up with hearing homophobic on campus should a black student have to put up being called a nigger or is it perfectly fine for someone to go on a soap box and talk about how the holocaust wa a great idea obviously those are extreme and do nt happen often i hope but do you think all speech no matter what should be acceptable at university even if it s horribly racisthomophobicsexisttransphobic bile
AH this is pathetic read a damn wikipedia page and tell u what you think about anything you ve clearly put zero thought into actual political stance or view so you are nt worth engaging politics is nt about picking a label and sticking to it it s about your philosophy of people and the world so come back when you ve put an ounce of effort into it
NONE rich they get all the bitch while i m here i ve noticed a small discrepancy in the content of your current post and that of your op it seem you support ubi which would be a direct contradiction to libertarian thought how is that you can hold that view and still maintain that liberstarianism is the one true political philosophy that literally everyone should follow
AH some belief are harmful to society some actions are harmful to society it is not the place of medicine to determine what belief are and are not socially valid on one end of the spectrum racism sexism and cult can and should not be tolerated or supported you ca nt be serious that is grossly dangerous thinking an ha no place in this nation in the u all of those thing so long a they are not harmful to others must be allowed there are law about preventing people from acting on these belief but you can not get into legislating morality tolerated accepted to a majority of american atheism is wrong doe that mean that it should be ok for that majority to pas law against atheism i think belief that involve not receiving vaccination you keep confusing belief with action if you want a world where no one donates organ where are you getting this idea from the world should be you ca nt tell me what to do with my body
NONE you have nt really explained the second part of your argument the not religion part terrorism is caused by many factor and i think it would be unfair to say that religion is not one of them religion or rather most of the major religion promote dogma a something valuable and dogma is dangerous there really is nt any way people could be driven to suicide attack on innocent people without dogma of some form calling them mentally ill is not only factually wrong it s just an evasive attempt to avoid understanding people who are very different from you that s what george bush did when he called the terrorist of evil a different a they are from you and i they re still human they re delusional but not mentally ill what you are seeing is dogma at it most extreme and destructive where there is dogma there will always be these absurd and violent effect
AH virtue signally idiot i hate people who make up word and do nt know proper grammar we do nt want your organ they might spread the crazy virus you apparently have

AH call people he disagrees with child so you re just misrepresenting my argument yeah youre reasonable
NONE and i agree wholeheartedly just know that it is not a provable fact yet and other than that keep on keepin on
AH what is a science is determined by the singular scientific community oh so you re saying physicist have a say on what biological theory are right or wrong nope science is a systematic enterprise that creates build and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanation and prediction about the universe so where the fuck am i confused it seems you are the one who is confused and tried to look up shit to support your bullshit but found nothing and still tried to bullshit your way out not going to work people agreeingdisagreeing with theory doe nt affect whether they are true but it doe certainly affect whether they are scientific wrong it doe not also some of the most foundational theory in science are not reproducible eg evolution who the fuck told you the theory of evolution is most foundational it is foundation of what exactly before you look up something and make an as out of yourself again let me tell you it could be considered foundation for a very small niche of science like treatment method for different strain of virii it relies on the fact that certain strain of virii evolve out of another population given a certain drug but the foundation there is not the theory of evolution but the fact that this is reproducible in itself evolution is anything but most foundational in fact it is one of the least foundational accepted theory because assuming it a a foundation solves no real problem in science it wa not accepted by the scientific community at large until the s and it wa accepted after that because the reproducible work of other scientist also supported it
NONE what is the good to be gained of thinking critically about absolutely everything i mean critical thinking for to of thing is good because there are a lot of charlatan out there but we should think critically about critical thinking a well if faith provides comfort instead of existential angst provides an excuse to be moralcharitable and provides community to people there is little good in attacking those thing merely because they re built on hardtoswallow story again modern religion also doe a whole bunch of bad thing in addition to those good thing it may contribute to people not thinking critically about thing i m not sure on the causal relationship there but i personally believe that religion can move toward that hypothetical perfect world religion i discussed before bahai one of the most modern religion actually ha critical thinking encoded into it s being from the beginning i will now explain the fourth principle which is the acceptance of the relation between religion and science http referencebahaiorgentabptpthtml there is no contradiction between true religion and science when a religion is opposed to science it becomes mere superstition that which is contrary to knowledge is ignorance how can a man believe to be a fact that which science ha proved to be impossible so i guess it really depends do you think religion can exist without any of it s negative effect or are the negative effect impossible to untangle fully from faith because if faith inherently ha negative thing riding alongside it then your statement is reasonable but if it s possible to remove those negative then the practice of religion should end is a little insulting
AH thats how most of america see these rd party including me prove him and me wrong instead of commenting like a child
NONE do nt think of it a punishment think of it a doing your duty a a citizen to help white leftist resolve their guilt issue
AH that specifically say speed and that make sense but lifting thing is nt the same it s not perception it s reading comprehension and you send to have missed the mark there ya i know it s a side issue but you attacked me a of i wa attacking someone that wa transgendered
NONE your point is that it s the worst and most overlooked issue i do nt think anyone disagrees that it s shitty when used poorly i disagree that it s a prevalent issue at all i m not quibbling that it s not a problem i m arguing that it s not a big problem at all
AH well it is my view you re trying to change and my argument you re nominally engaging with ya but if you re gon na be a condescending douche about it and try to move the goalpost every time i make an argument i m gon na have a hard time changing your view not so it s a regression to way thing were before progress no there wa no muslim ban or border wall before it is a move toward positive progress trump is nt trying to bring back the chinese exclusion act for the sake of regression
NONE the point of the thought experiment is to see if your valuing of hard work softens when it s someone at the top of the chain than when it s someone at the bottom and it appears that it doe this make me think that the issue is nt a hardline hard work is always good it s i do nt want to help someone who wo nt work hard and if that s central then it seems self reliance is your main concern not hard work and in that case you should nt think about it in term of hard work at all
AH wow what an asshole that wa a completely unwarranted reply you gtfo
NONE that s a terrible argument imho it s no le horrible a thing to a person who is guilty
AH batshit is nt funny any more in fact it wa never funny grow up
NONE oh absolutely when ever it ha life already doe nt matter only good xenos is a dead xenos
AH consent to interact with someone physically in a legal manner you need consent this includes fighting sex handshake etc you can not just legally choose to harvest organ even from a corpse the person ha to give consent and ha to specify what may be taken a some religion have sacred organ and to infringe upon their belief is a human right violation therefore the default is that the person doe not consent to donate organ and may choose to donate by their own will neither you nor a doctor nor the entire collective of the human race get to decide what someone want to do you can oppose them or convince them but choosing for them is tyrannical also the public outrage at this kind of sneaky shit would be enough to spark riot nationwide if the loved one of an unwilling donor find out that organ have been harvested without the person s consent and then check their own status and find that they are automatically included to donate what do you think would happen the news would spread like wildfire trust in government and hospital would plummet and the door to anarchy would swing open you do nt harvest organ without knowing consent what are you dumb
NONE besides no moral argument give anyone the right to take someone else s organ against their will even after they ve deceased disagree if i or a loved one needed an organ and your dead body is housing it unused i would feel morally justified in — if legally barred from — taking it i m not taking it against your will you are dead you no longer have a will there is no unquestionable moral obligation to donate your organ to a stranger well except that you seem to be saying that society ha a moral obligation to offer every individual the best care in welfare we task those with an abundance of wealth to provide for those lacking wealth the same could be said of organ refusal to donate organ should be met with a penalty what penalty i refuse to accept that one can simultaneously have the choice not to donate organ and still be entitled to receive them if you are not entitled to organ then you are not being penalized when you do nt get one you are simply not prioritized to get one amongst the several hundred other people that also are waiting for the same organ if you still see this a a penalty then yeah i guess i would say that refusal to donate should be met with a penalty we should punish the wickedly selfish
AH i find it incredibly pretentious when someone claim that it is naive to think differently maybe in some case yes but your postulation is a baseless a you believe op s to be also you are being melodramatic in your wwii analogy let s be real about this for moment and put aside all the patriotism and flag waving the military is essentially a socialized job program which also happens to fund major segment of the american economy most war we have participated in have been for three reason keeping the national or global status quo acquisition of land and keeping the wealthy wealthy
NONE that s fair just be careful that you re maintaining perspective on how prevalent this is and not letting the fact that you know something exists due perhaps to research mislead you into believing that it s happening a lot kid got kidnapped in the united state in the s and s but people especially parent only got crazy concerned about it because it got so much more medium coverage than usual i know the u medium could nt care le about the plight of foreigner no matter how horrific it may be but it s possible for an individual to do that to himself a well
AH if you really wanted your view changed and people to respond to this post for that reason and you also do nt believe the problem is having to do with race why would you use such a stupid and incendiary title that completely opposes the body of your post
NONE tl dr just read the the title i agree with out knowing about preop status one ca nt consent after surgery it doe nt matter because your physical body match the sex you are cheer
AH save your manufactured offense for your tumblr the name for this trope is simply the name of the character it wa coined from it applies to character of any gender

AH definitely not true many artist only become famous after they die others become homeless especially early recording artist who used to get really screwed over on record deal and barely made any money despite being famous again when they get famous after they die their work is now worth money if you sign a major label record contract you get advance that are pretty generous plus a small cut of record sale musician are nt the best at saving money it s pretty clear you have an idea of what artist are like in your mind which really doe nt match up with reality again a strawman i do nt have museum in my mind typical mueseumgoer look at this painting what doe it say to you hand on chin with a slanted glance act like you do nt know what i m talking about artist typically try to act more interesting than they are example http wwwdailymotioncomvideoxmvrhalfbakedcreativesmokerfun i think you re assuming that the term artist confers some degree of skill you thought wrong referring to yourself a an artist instead of i draw i sculpt etc mean it s a profession and mean you re proficient your use of confer make me believe you re one of these artistytype tryhard douchebags whatever a house builder is carpenter maybe excuse me i said house instead of home fucking nerd anyone who make art can call themselves an artist if you re socially maladjusted and want to seem like you are talking yourself up when you re not even an amateur sure if not you usually say i like to paint i like to weld etc but you can be an artist writer carpenter etc and not have that a a profession usually when people refer to themselves a something it is their profession otherwise they would say i cook i write i do carpentry etc btw you re the worst kind of nerd an idiot but still try very hard
NONE first of all even young grad with practical degree are nt finding job so whether you pursue action or punish yourself learning accounting sorry accountant i m sure it s fascinating really you may still find yourself out of work second outside of professional degree like engineering law or medicine the vast majority of people end up working outside of their major third acting provides skill that are transferable to mundane job the ability to be comfortable speaking in front of people the ability to think on your foot improv the ability to socialize fourth you re not being naive about this you are realistic and understand that there is a significant risk due to pay and that it might not work out the odds are indeed against you a long a you keep that in mind and know that at some point you need to consider a plan b instead of waiting for that big break that s never coming you ll be ok fifth and most importantly art matters even if you re in some small production between food service job theater transforms people even more important it transforms you at least i assume so otherwise you would nt be considering this path the actor and musician i know are alive on stage more than at any other time if there is a chance that you can do this thing that make you happy and complete and get paid to do it it s worth rolling the dice there s plenty of time left to do stuff you hate because you have bill to pay so why give up on the dream before you ve even tried i do nt know if it s inappropriate to post stuff like this here but i wrote a blog post a few month ago about my son considering pursuing music an it seems relevant but i m happy to remove the link if it s bad form http cynoptwordpresscomisprudenceprudent break a leg
AH here maybe this will help elucidate the concept then you should have said arithmetic mean not average the arithmetic mean is useless anyway in this situation what s sexist about it a swamp donkey is a fat promiscuous girl oh okay since there s nothing left otherwise you ll ostensibly stop replying oh yeah if you after the whole comment chain you re still not seeing an salient point then there s not much else to discus all i m seeing on your end is a bunch of big word and a guy who visit the brook brother outlet more than he doe his own invalid grandmother which mean the average voter doe not in fact decide the issue in practice or in theory do you even want citizen to be involved in their government at all
NONE by that logic are you saying that it is reasonable for me to be a lesbian until i start operating in the public space not quite because your being something ha no bearing on me i m saying that you can basically do or think whatever you want until you start involving other people because unless you live out in the desert by yourself you have to take society into account for example you own the only grocery store for mile but your religion forbids you from selling anything to homosexual anyone who is gay must now travel to the next town over in order to buy food is this okay i ve never understood the argument that they can also claim discrimination it s like that paradox of tolerance http enwikipediaorgwikiparadoxoftolerance thing where it just doe nt make sense that they can call themselves a victim if their intolerance is the only thing that they re being discriminated for

AH so is he an asshole or not that powerfull this is a challenge to the christianjewishislamic claim of an allpowerful and alllovinggood being it doe not apply here and your contstant reapeating of it show you to be a complete dimwit we already have a word for universe it s universe why do we need another one the energy within your brain make you conscious god is all energy therefore god is conscious this is why i call it god no i am adressing your god why would an infinite being of all matter and energy give a fuck about your day to day life when you could never alter it plan life is pointless but that clearly exist you clearly ca nt fathom any type of concept of divinity other than the western religion you were bombarded with growing up
NONE i m an atheist so this probably is nt the reply you were expecting but it come down to your sense of time ever have a dream where it felt like multiple day have passed but really it only been an hour what if when you die your perception of time shift such that you can live what feel like an eternity in heaven your mind dy and it all over eventually but from your perspective it go on for a long a you still have a perspective we know that nothing is accredited to magic disagree everything is accredited to magic until we understand it take an iphone back year and it will be seen a magic we simply lacked the understanding to comprehend such a device why do you think we have the scientific understanding capable of understanding what happens when we die
